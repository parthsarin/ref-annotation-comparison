                    <p>We will search broadly by using electronic bibliographic databases, broad internet search, and contacting experts in the field of reproducibility, replicability, and open science. Any study investigating interventions for their influence on the reproducibility and replicability of research will be selected, including those studies additionally investigating drivers and barriers to the implementation and effectiveness of interventions. Studies will first be selected by title and abstract (if available), semi-automated, and then by reading the full text by at least two independent reviewers. We will analyze existing scientific evidence using scoping review and evidence gap mapping methodologies.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>One of the scientific research objectives is to test theories, typically by accumulating knowledge derived from individual studies. This process is contingent on the reliability of previous findings that serve as the foundation for subsequent research. One of the essential prerequisites for trustworthy research findings is reproducibility, which entails obtaining the same results when rerunning (parts of) projects using the same design and data. Unfortunately, research findings frequently cannot be reproduced due to, for example, inadequate information provided to rerun the experiment or analysis (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1">Alsheikh-Ali

                    <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). The EU report on the reproducibility of research results in EU framework programmes (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-4">European Commission, Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, 2022</xref>) shows that many researchers rarely indicate to share their data, analysis code, or materials. This is problematic not only for the reproducibility of experiments but also for their ability to be replicated in other samples. Ensuring the reproducibility and replicability of scientific results is critical to the rigor and quality of research. When they are ignored, there is a risk that inaccurate, biased, or spurious results can gain undue attention in the literature leading to substantial research waste and flawed decision-making. Strategies to increase reproducibility and replicability have primarily focused on improving research transparency through various open science practices. These aim to ensure that the research process is documented and widely accessible so that it can be checked, critiqued, re-used, and built upon in future research. Ongoing initiatives, such as the ReproducibiliTEA network, aim to facilitate the implementation of these practices in the research process. However, the extent to which these and other practices and interventions have been empirically investigated, and their actual impact on reproducibility and replicability, are unclear. We, therefore, aim to understand the evidence base for interventions for increasing the reproducibility and replicability of research and the documented barriers and facilitators in the process of creating more reproducible and replicable research using scoping review and evidence mapping methodology.</p>

Title and abstract screening started in June 2023 based on a finished protocol. A well-constructed search strategy is the core of the systematic review. Due to the complexity of our search objectives, we revised the search string throughout the T&amp;A screening in order to improve its quality. The final search string will be published with this protocol. The final search string for Medline can be found in the section describing the search strategy. Potential changes to the protocol during the research process will be reported transparently. All additions to the protocol, such as data extraction sheets and data analysis plans, will be added to the OSF folder of this project under DOI

                <p>Our primary objective is to evaluate which interventions, such as open science practices, have been investigated for their effectiveness in improving reproducibility and replicability in science. These interventions can be applied on various levels (researchers, institutes, funders, publishers, editors, etc.). The search strategy will focus on this objective.</p>
                <p>The secondary objective is to investigate which drivers and barriers to the implementation and effectiveness of these interventions have been identified in these interventional studies.</p>

                <p>We will include studies evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention in promoting the reproducibility or replicability of scientific methods and findings and those additionally testing drivers and barriers of the process. Studies will be included independent of the specific approach applied to measure the outcome variable(s), such as using proxies or direct indicators of the outcomes.</p>
                <p>In addition to studies that explicitly evaluate interventions for reproducibility/replicability, we will also consider studies that assess the effectiveness of interventions related to practices commonly claimed within the literature to support reproducibility/reproducibility to be in the scope of this review. The complete list of such proxies is included in 
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> and is based upon two criteria: the project team&#x2019;s synthesis of key, widely cited prescriptive texts that provide a conceptual framework for the selection made (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-5">Munaf&#x00f2;

                <p>Various study designs will be considered for inclusion in this research. To evaluate an intervention, comparisons must be made either between or within subjects. Studies that do not have a comparator will be included only if the intervention is explicitly stated and the outcome variable measures reproducibility or replicability (for example, the prevalence of data sharing in journals with open science policies). These studies are included since they provide relevant information when compared with other studies (e.g., the prevalence of data sharing in journals without open science policy). Studies only investigating the prevalence of certain practices, such as data-sharing, are not included. Reviews will be included to apply the snowballing methodology to identify relevant literature, and since they might contain additional relevant information that is retrieved by the comparison and summary of primary studies. Reviews will be summarized separately to avoid duplication of primary studies in the evidence map. Furthermore, we include studies that investigate facilitators and barriers in addition to evaluating the effectiveness of interventions on reproducibility and replicability (e.g., as moderator). When only drivers and barriers are assessed, for example, in the form of a survey or similar describing the opinions of multiple individuals without testing any intervention, these studies will be marked as such in the full-text screening phase. Including these articles in the analysis is beyond this project's scope. However, these papers are essential for understanding researchers' practices and decisions and compiling them might serve as a starting point for further projects. Article types such as position papers, study protocols, and other literature without primary data will not be considered. Additionally, we will search for and exclude retracted articles.</p>

The proposed search will initially be developed for Medline and subsequently be translated to all databases. The search string for Medline can be found at the end of this section. No date or language restriction will be used. Grey literature will be searched separately by scanning websites of major policy actors (such as EC, Science Europe, EUA, NSF) for relevant interventional studies. After identifying relevant references, they will be used for reference and citation checking to determine potentially missed studies. The results from the searches will be collected in

                <p>The title and abstract of all records identified through the respective search strategies will be screened for potential eligibility in duplicate independently. When there are disagreements, a third reviewer will be involved to resolve discrepancies in the selection of articles. The full-text manuscripts belonging to the titles and abstracts considered potentially eligible will then be read and selected for inclusion in duplicate independently. In this phase as well, disagreements will be solved by a third author.</p>

                <p>The data extraction sheet, including extraction instructions and terminology definitions, will be developed in cooperation with the whole team. After extracting the first ten papers, the extraction sheet will be piloted and potentially adapted. Data extraction will be conducted in duplicate by two or more reviewers independently. Disagreements will be solved through discussion and additional consultation of a third reviewer. Data will be extracted from study documents and recorded in EPPI Reviewer across the items listed below. In case of insufficient data, we will attempt to contact the document&#x2019;s authors for additional information. The following data will be extracted (if applicable):</p>

                <p>As this is a scoping review, we will not assess the risk of bias of each individual study included. We will, however, check for each article what the design was and whether a comparison was included (see data-extraction items).</p>

                <title>Data synthesis and analysis</title>
                <p>All included studies will be summarized in a narrative synthesis.</p>
                <p>The evidence will be mapped according to the intervention (rows) and reproducibility/replicability (columns) using the EPPI Reviewer software (EPPI Centre Software). Additionally, an adapted version of the categorization, as described by

                        <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. (2022)</xref>, will be applied to cluster different kinds of interventions.</p>
                <p>The outcomes of reviews will not be included as a row in the evidence map but described separately. Evidence mapping will produce an interactive, searchable database of relevant studies, a list of knowledge gaps, and visualizations such as evidence atlases, heat maps, or descriptive plots. If possible, this will be done semi-automatically as well (using EPPI-reviewer, for example). These will aid in identifying gaps in the evidence and ways to address them. The exact layout of these figures will be determined after we have piloted the data extraction sheet.</p>

            <p>The manuscript is a study protocol identifying the rationale and methodology for conducting evidence mapping of interventions for increasing reproducibility and replicability. I find the study very interesting and relevant given the current need to identify whether and how open science improves credibility and impact of research. Overall, methodology is well described and developed for this stage of the research. I only have several relatively minor comments/suggestions for the MS.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> My main comment is about the scope of the mapping which is somewhat not consistently described through the MS. This is relevant for two aspects:

                        <p>Reading the Background, I&#x2019;ve got the impression this work will look into the strength of the evidence (the last sentence of the Background). However, it is mapping the literature that contains the evidence, rather than calculating some effect sizes from the evidence. I think it would be useful that the text reflects this. E.g. last sentence of the Background could be something like &#x2018; Much of the literature has looked at the evidence that xxx but this literature has not been systematically mapped.&#x2019; Similar, the sentence of the Introduction: &#x2018; However, the extent to which these and other practices &#x2026;. Etc&#x2019; gives the impression that some effect sizes will be calculated from the obtained evidence.</p>

                        <p>The title and the aims are about any practices that can improve reproducibility and replicability. However, the Interventions that are listed in the Fig 2 are only about Open practices.</p>
                    </list-item>
                </list> Some minor comments: 
                <list list-type="order">
                    <list-item>
                        <p>In the Background section of the abstract, please consider adding &#x2018;/replicability&#x2019; to read &#x2018;.. combat the reproducibility/replicability crisis.&#x2019; While I understand that reproducibility crisis is the original term that was used to describe non-replication of study results, maybe it would be easier for the reader to have both terms mentioned in the Background section.</p>

                    <list-item>
                        <p>I do not understand why are the listed proxy outcomes (Fig 1) in fact proxies for the main outcomes. Could you explain the reasoning behind these?</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>Fig 2: Under &#x2018; Other&#x2019;&#x00a0; it is unclear why these exact terms were chosen? Why not p-hacking reduction, or HARKING reduction?</p>

                    <list-item>
                        <p>The MS could better highlight that mapping the barriers and facilitators is not fully systematic, as it will be done based on the literature obtained via the main search (which is to identify practices and their potential impacts), and not by an interdependent search of the literature on facilitators/barriers.</p>

                        <p>Could you please provide a very brief explanation on why Risk of Bias will not be assessed?</p>

                    <list-item>
                        <p>Maybe change the date for the &#x2018;Anticipated end of the study&#x2019;?</p>

            <p>Is the study design appropriate for the research question?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Are sufficient details of the methods provided to allow replication by others?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Is the rationale for, and objectives of, the study clearly described?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Are the datasets clearly presented in a useable and accessible format?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <p>I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above.</p>
