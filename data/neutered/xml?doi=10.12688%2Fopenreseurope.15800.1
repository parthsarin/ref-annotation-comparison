            <abstract>
                <p>Survey data on migration aspirations, plans and intentions is important for understanding the drivers and dynamics of migration. Such data has been collected since the 1960s but has expanded massively in recent decades. This paper provides the first comprehensive overview of existing survey data in an inventory of 212 surveys with recorded metadata on geographic and temporal coverage, survey population, sample size, and other characteristics. &#x2018;A survey&#x2019; is not always a clear-cut unit of analysis, but we adopted procedures that enable systematic comparisons, and identified surveys through systematic searches and follow-up investigation. The paper has three objectives. First, it facilitates reuse of survey data and secondary analysis, albeit with limitations in data access, which we document. Second, it helps consolidate a sprawling field and thereby contribute to methodological and theoretical strengthening. Third, it informs debates on the ethics, politics and biases of data collection by documenting broad patterns in the body of knowledge. The inventory of survey data on migration aspirations and related concepts gives migration researchers a new tool for locating existing data and strengthening the foundations for collecting new data.</p>

            <p>Why do some people wish to leave their current homes and others not? What are the origins of migration plans, hopes and dreams? Researchers have studied these questions through survey data for decades. This article presents an overview of surveys on migration aspirations, plans, and intentions collected since the 1960s. Our inventory of surveys contains information on the surveys&#x2019; geographic focus, data collection period, survey population and methodology. By providing such an overview of surveys on migration aspirations, plans, and intensions, this paper facilitates reuse of the survey data and exposes patterns and biases in the focus of this research over the past decades. As such, the inventory of surveys helps researchers locate existing survey data and plan new data collection.</p>

            <title>1 Introduction</title>
            <p id="S1">The study of migration has benefitted from collecting and analysing survey data on individuals&#x2019; thoughts and feelings regarding the possibility of moving elsewhere. In line with recent developments in migration theory, we use &#x2018;migration aspirations&#x2019; as the umbrella term to cover these mental constructs in their various forms, including desires, intentions, plans and expectations for migration (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-46">Carling, 2002</xref>; 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-51">Carling &amp; Schewel, 2018</xref>; 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-74">de Haas, 2021</xref>; 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-168">Koikkalainen &amp; Kyle, 2016</xref>).</p>
            <p>Within migration studies, survey data on migration aspirations complements population data by allowing for incorporation of fine-grained information on attitudes and behaviour. Moreover, it complements survey data on migrants, which offers limited insight on the drivers of migration because it is sampled on the dependent variable.</p>
            <p>Data on migration aspirations has in part been used in attempts to predict or forecast migration flows (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-265">Tjaden 
                    <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). Even though most prospective migrants face daunting obstacles and end up staying, variations in the incidence of migration can shed light on the evolution of migration flows. Moreover, there are additional reasons for studying migration aspirations (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-14">Aslany 
                    <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-48">Carling, 2019</xref>). First, if we want to understand what 
                <italic toggle="yes">motivates</italic> migration, it is insufficient to study actual migration. Factors such as poverty, corruption, crime, or environmental degradation could affect peoples&#x2019; wish to move elsewhere (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-14">Aslany 
                    <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-68">Czaika &amp; Reinprecht, 2022</xref>). Whether or not they lead to people crossing borders is a separate issue, governed not least by restrictive migration policies and other obstacles. Visa restrictions have, for instance, been found to decrease emigration (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-67">Czaika &amp; de Haas, 2017</xref>). Second, migration aspirations could affect behaviour in other ways than migration, especially when the desire to leave remains unfulfilled for many years. People who wait for a chance to leave could, for instance, be less inclined to invest in local livelihoods, skills or relationships, with consequences for their own lives and societies.</p>
            <p>From a policy perspective, insights on migration aspirations are essential for influencing migration flows and reducing the negative consequences of migration. As we will show, many surveys specifically target health workers and medical students and could provide insights that help stem the loss of human capital through emigration. More generally, factors that are strongly associated with a wish to leave can help set priorities for social policy.</p>
            <p>In this paper we present a first of a kind systematic 
                <italic toggle="yes">inventory of surveys</italic> that have collected data on migration aspirations. The inventory provides an overview of survey data and metadata from the past five decades to encourage further use and inform future research. (We are separately examining survey items and questionnaire design, and developing a 
                <italic toggle="yes">question bank</italic> on migration aspirations; see 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-49">Carling &amp; Mjelva, 2021</xref> for a preliminary version).</p>
            <p>The study of migration aspirations touch upon several areas of migration research. This diversity is reflected in our references. In the inventory of surveys, we cite a total of 250 sources, of which 205 are journal articles. The articles are spread across 72 journals of which only 24 occur more than once. 
                <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> lists them with their respective number of articles. Not surprisingly, the largest number of articles using data on migration aspirations are published in major migration journals. Other journals represent the fields of population studies, urban studies, development studies, rural studies and health policy.</p>

            <title>2 The inventory of surveys</title>
            <p id="S2">In general, survey datasets exist in a variety of forms, with disparate degrees of public documentation and data availability. As a rule, they are not systematically indexed in databases in the way that, for instance, journal articles are. These factors make a review of surveys very different from a systematic review of literature.</p>
            <p>We used publications as a gateway to establish an overview of surveys. Since we were looking for surveys that included items on migration aspirations, we conducted a search through Web of Science for literature that is survey-based and includes migration aspirations or related terms such as migration intentions or desires in the title or abstracts.
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN1">1</xref>
                </sup> This search produced 287 hits, which were subsequently screened to identify publications that used relevant data. In addition, we searched the authors&#x2019; reference library of several thousand migration-related references, of which many relate specifically to migration aspirations. This library contains both articles, books, reports, and other publication types. Finally, the reference lists of selected articles were reviewed to identify additional potentially pertinent literature. Throughout the process, we did not discriminate by publication type or publication year. In total, we identified 289 publications that used survey data on migration aspirations, stemming from 212 surveys.</p>
            <p>Inclusion in the inventory of surveys is contingent on three requirements. First, the survey must be of a quantitative nature, meaning that it must be structured with pre-formulated, standardised questions. However, no threshold concerning sample size was set to distinguish quantitative from qualitative surveys.</p>
            <p>Second, the survey must contain at least one question inquiring about respondents&#x2019; migration aspirations. The question could concern residential mobility, domestic migration, international migration or migration at different geographical thresholds. It must, however, address the prospect of future migration, not respondents&#x2019; experience with migration in the past.</p>
            <p>Third, it must be possible to obtain a minimum of information about the survey and survey instrument, beyond the fact that a survey exists. We did not have strict rules as to which metadata had to be available but needed 
                <italic toggle="yes">some</italic> information, for example about the topic of the survey, the survey population, or geographic coverage, for it to be meaningful to include the survey in the inventory. Metadata on surveys is occasionally missing for data collection method (16%), sampling method (10%), data collection period (6%), survey design (6%) and sample size (1%). For the purpose of gaining an overview of relevant surveys, we included surveys with satisfactory survey-level information even if the information about specific survey items was faulty. The inventory of surveys contains the best information available in the referenced publications or survey documentation.</p>
            <p>Each row in the inventory refers to one survey. Many surveys have rounds that vary in methodology, sample size, geographic coverage, or content of the survey instrument. Consequently, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between rounds and independent surveys. This difficulty is compounded by the uneven availability of metadata, depending on how various rounds or parts of surveys have been used in publications. We have coded surveys as multi-round whenever they are described as such in the reference or survey documentation.</p>
            <p>Each survey is given a numeric ID, assigned in the order of the first year of data collection, and then alphabetically by survey name among surveys with the same start year. If publications did not contain information about the data collection period, we assigned IDs with the assumption that data was collected three years before the publication year. In a few cases, information about additional rounds emerged during the review, with the result that not all IDs reflect the chronology of data collection.</p>
            <p>Additionally, each survey in the inventory has a unique descriptive name. Some, like 
                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.afrobarometer.org/">Afrobarometer</ext-link> or 
                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"
                      xlink:href="https://www.gallup.com/analytics/318875/global-research.aspx">Gallup World Poll</ext-link>, have well-established official names. Others &#x2013; especially one-off surveys carried out for a particular project &#x2013; often lack a specific designation. In these cases, we have used the available information to formulate a name, such as &#x2018;Migration Intentions among University Students in Slovakia&#x2019; or &#x2018;Hubei Province Migration Survey&#x2019;.</p>
            <p>The inventory of surveys includes references to publications that have used each survey, typically the publication(s) through which each survey was identified in the first place. Hence, the list does not necessarily include all references that have used the survey but shows where we discovered the data. Some publications use several surveys and are therefore listed in several rows.</p>
            <p>Although the search for surveys has been extensive and the list of surveys is long, we cannot assume that it is exhaustive. In particular, surveys carried out by international organizations, civil-society organizations, or private-sector actors are less likely to be used in scientific publications and could therefore more easily have been missed.</p>

                <p>We have classified the geographic scale of surveys as

                    <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>. The multinational surveys cover between 2 and 155 countries, with a median of 6. Three surveys have a globally diverse coverage: the Gallup World Poll (76), which covers more than 150 countries, the International Social Survey Programme (18), which covers 42 countries and the Pew Global Attitudes Survey (51), which covers 25 countries. Almost all the remaining multinational surveys span a set of neighbouring countries within the same region.</p>

                <p>Very few multinational surveys concentrate on migration issues. All those that cover more than seven countries are thematically broad surveys that have, at most, a handful of migration-related questions. By contrast, most of the multi-subnational surveys &#x2013; which cover two to eight countries &#x2013; are surveys that focus on migration or migration aspirations.</p>
                <p>This variation in geographic scale cuts across variation in the 
                    <italic toggle="yes">survey population</italic>, which we discuss in 
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="S3.4">Section 3.4</xref>. In other words, a national survey can target a highly specific population, such as British doctors in New Zealand (112) or Russian-origin immigrants in Israel (165). When we classify surveys as national or multinational &#x2013; that is, with the aim of being nationally representative &#x2013; we rely on descriptions in the cited publications or other survey documentation and have not evaluated the actual representativeness. However, surveys differ in the compromises they must make in the attempt to be representative at the national level.</p>
                <p>The largest group of surveys are subnational, followed by the national ones. Only one in five cover more than one country. This distribution is unsurprising considering the lower resource requirements for subnational surveys. Some are products of graduate research, for instance.</p>
                <p>The variation in geographic scale is partly linked to differences in the form of migration that is the focus of the survey. Many surveys explicitly address international migration, while others address internal migration or local residential mobility, and yet others do not discriminate between internal and international destinations.</p>
                <p>The surveys cover countries from all parts of the world, though with clear imbalances. Classifying the geographical coverage of surveys is, in most cases, straightforward, though not always in surveys that cover migrant populations or that vary across rounds.

Europe and Central Asia top the list and strikingly account for half of all the surveys.

                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> offers a more fine-grained picture, displaying the country-level frequency of coverage. Of the 20 countries that appear in ten or more surveys, only three are non-European: the United States, Mexico, and China. In fact, the United States is the single most studied country, represented in 30 surveys. Next are the United Kingdom and Romania, with 20 surveys each. In addition to Romania, five other Central and Eastern European countries are among the ten most frequently represented (Hungary, Bulgaria, Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia). This concentration of surveys partly reflects the policy-related interest in monitoring and forecasting East-West migration within Europe, triggered by the collapse of communist regimes, and later, by the expansion of the European Union. Yet, many of the surveys in Central and Eastern Europe are multinational or multi-subnational and tend to cover the same countries. For instance, Hungary and the Czech Republic appear together in 13 surveys. (The previously mentioned ambiguities about what should count as one survey also affect the numbers on country-level coverage.

In contrast, the United States and China stand out with particularly many surveys of this type. Most of these surveys address internal migration. In the case of the United States, some focus on residential mobility in a single metropolitan area.</p>

                <p>The most common specific population category is 
                    <italic toggle="yes">students</italic>. The prominence of students has several possible explanations. Some surveys are linked to the growing interest in international student mobility, especially in Europe. Other surveys among students may be motivated by concerns about human capital losses (so-called &#x2018;brain drain&#x2019;, see for instance 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-117">Gibson &amp; McKenzie, 2011</xref> for more information about the concept). Finally, student populations can be appealing for logistical and financial reasons when sampling and recruitment can be organized through schools, universities or associations. Migration aspirations is particularly prominent among youth and young adults, who, in many countries, are likely to be students. Consequently, a sample of students could reflect an interest in the age group, combined with logistical sampling considerations, rather than a specific emphasis on respondents being students.</p>
                <p>A second prominent category includes 
                    <italic toggle="yes">migrant populations</italic>, which in some surveys include children of migrants (78, 90, 127). It is common in surveys of migrants to include questions about plans or wishes for return or onward migration, which can be seen as a particular form of migration aspirations.</p>
                <p>The third most frequent category is 
                    <italic toggle="yes">health workers</italic>, often defined as physicians or nurses. The emigration of health workers is a major policy concern in many countries, and understanding their migration aspirations, and the underlying motivations can therefore be important. The majority of these surveys were undertaken in European countries with significant out-migration, such as Ireland, Poland and Portugal.</p>
                <p>The prominence of student, migrant, and health worker populations was reflected in several overlaps between these categories. We have therefore singled out health worker migrants and health sciences students as population categories.</p>
                <p>In addition to differences in population type, the surveys differ considerably in the age range of their samples &#x2013; as well as in the level of detail on age that is provided in publications. We have used the available information to classify the surveys into three broad groups (
                    <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>). The most important difference between surveys is the upper bound of the age range, which we use as the criteria for distinguishing between 
                    <italic toggle="yes">adult</italic>, 
                    <italic toggle="yes">young adult</italic>, and 
                    <italic toggle="yes">youth</italic> samples. The lower bound of the age range also varies, though not always in expected ways. For instance, some surveys covering the adult population include individuals down to the age of 14.</p>

                <p>A fundamental aspect of survey design is the way of which data is collected over time. There can be one or more rounds of data collection, and if there are several rounds, respondents can be the same or be replaced in each round.

                <p>Overall, about a third of the surveys have multi-round or longitudinal designs, allowing for analyses of trends or dynamics over time. These are primarily surveys of the general population. There is only one such survey among the 21 that cover workers and students in the health sector.</p>
                <p>Comparability and continuity across multiple rounds of a survey vary. First, the selection of countries or other aspects of the target population could differ. Afrobarometer (168) for instance, has collected data in multiple rounds since 1999 and covered a total of 40 countries, but the first round covered only 12. Similarly, the survey Living Conditions among Immigrants in Norway (78) has been carried out roughly every decade, covering a selection of immigrant groups that has changed from round to round. Second, questions about migration aspirations are not necessarily included, or formulated in the same way, in every round.</p>
                <p>Survey respondents can be sampled in diverse ways, which we have classified in three broad categories (
                    <xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">Table 7</xref>). 
                    <italic toggle="yes">Random or quasi-random</italic> sampling methods seek to give each individual in the population the same probability of being included in the sample. In practice, randomness is a matter of degree, depending on compromises that are made in the design and execution of the survey. At the same time, standards for describing a survey as &#x2018;random&#x2019; vary across research communities. We therefore use a broad category that also includes quasi-random designs in which the deviations from randomness are explicit. Two thirds of the surveys in the inventory of surveys fall into this category.</p>

                <p>The second method is what we have called 
                    <italic toggle="yes">institutional</italic> sampling, in which individuals are sampled on the basis of an institutional affiliation. Examples include students at a university, employees of a company, members of an association, and similarly aggregated samples from multiple institutions of the same type. In some cases, the gross sample is the same as the population. For instance, if the population is defined as all medical students in a country, the entire population might be contacted 
                    <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> their universities, and the difference between the population and the sample would be accounted for by non-response. Overall, 17% of the surveys used institutional sampling. This proportion was twice as high in surveys of students and represented the vast majority of surveys on health workers.</p>
                <p>Third, several surveys used explicitly 
                    <italic toggle="yes">non-random</italic> sampling methods. These include snowball sampling, by which respondents refer to other potential respondents. Surveys that authors describe as non-probabilistic have been placed in this category. Non-random sampling was used in only 6% of the surveys.</p>
                <p>Basic information about sampling methods was missing for 10% of the surveys. In most cases, the publications or documentation mentioned sampling but described it too briefly or superficially for classification. Without proper information about sampling method, it is impossible to assess the representativity of surveys.</p>
                <p>The sample size of the surveys varies by a factor of 4,000 from the smallest (40 respondents) to the largest (161,000 respondents). For multi-round surveys we have recorded the sample size as reported in the publications that are cited as sources for each survey. If information is available for more than one round, we have used the largest sample size.</p>

                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref> displays the distribution of surveys by sample size and population category. Only one survey (76, the Gallup World Poll) has a sample of more than 100,000 respondents, while another 36 surveys have samples of 10,000 respondents or more. As can be seen in 
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>, surveys of the general population dominate among these large surveys, although there are surveys of every other main population category with samples of at least 10,000 respondents. Several of the largest surveys are multinational and their samples for each country are not necessarily large.</p>

                <p>The majority of surveys collect data by means of interviews, either in person or by phone. Compared to self-administered data collection, interviews provide greater opportunities for quality assurance, though this potential depends on interviewer skills and training. The feasibility of self-administered data collection depends, among other things, on the qualifications of respondents and the complexity of the survey.</p>
                <p>Even with a simple distinction between two broadly defined data collection methods, 33 surveys (16%) were not possible to classify based on the available information. A few surveys combined the two formats. In some cases, publications stated that data was collected by means of questionnaires but failed to specify whether they were completed by interviewers or respondents.</p>

                <title>3.6 Summary of survey characteristics</title>
                <p id="S3.6">We have so far addressed key characteristics one by one and presented frequency distributions across categories in a series of tables. 
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref> provides a visual display of these frequency distributions. For each characteristic, the most common category accounts for more than half of the surveys. In other words, a &#x2018;typical&#x2019; survey that combines all the modal categories would be a single-round sub-national survey in Europe or Central Asia that covers the general population of adults with random or semi-random sampling and collects data through interviews. However, only five surveys (81, 157, 188, 200, 210) share this combination of characteristics.</p>

                <title>3.7 Data availability in sampled surveys</title>
                <p id="S3.7">It is increasingly the norm to make research data publicly available, though this is far from universally the case. We have coded the availability of survey data based on information in the publications or other documentation, in two broad categories. The survey data is deemed 
                    <italic toggle="yes">available</italic> if, according to the publications, it can either be downloaded or obtained upon request, with or without a fee, and with or without specific restrictions or conditions. Data from the remaining surveys is deemed 
                    <italic toggle="yes">not available</italic> (the two classifications are coded as &#x2018;yes&#x2019; and &#x2018;no&#x2019; in the stated data availability column of the underlying data). Overall, data was reported to be available for 25% of the surveys.</p>
                <p>The data availability information is an indication, but no guarantee either way. When a publication from several decades ago states that data is available upon request, it might not be possible to obtain today. Likewise, if publications do not state explicitly that data is available, it could, nevertheless, be possible to obtain upon request.</p>
                <p>Data availability varies systematically by survey type. To illustrate, 
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref> replicates the structure of 
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref> and uses stated data availability instead of regional coverage. We see that data is more likely to be available for surveys of the general population as opposed to specific population groups. Moreover, stated data availability is highest for national and multinational surveys. It is only among multinational surveys of the general population that a majority of datasets are available.</p>

            <title>4 Concluding remarks</title>
            <p id="S4">We have presented a first-of-a-kind inventory of surveys that enquire about migration aspirations. For understanding migration processes, the data produced by such surveys is an essential complement to data on migration itself (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-51">Carling &amp; Schewel, 2018</xref>; 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-74">de Haas 2021</xref>).</p>
            <p>The work of compiling the inventory of surveys yielded two overall conclusions (1) there is a rich diversity of datasets that address migration aspirations, and (2) the standards of documentation are disappointingly low. Surprisingly often, basic information about surveys was missing from publications or difficult to obtain through the sources that were referenced. These weaknesses point to potentials for improved practice at all stages of the survey research process. In the following, we briefly summarize the implications.</p>
            <p>When surveys are carried out, precise information about the survey design, population parameters, geographic coverage, sampling procedures, data collection method and data collection period should be documented. In the course of running the survey, such documentation might be scattered across e-mails, meetings notes, and internal memos, and require deliberate effort to compile for posterity.</p>
            <p>When data collection has been completed, survey documentation should be made securely accessible to others. Even if the data itself remains restricted, there are rarely good reasons to limit access to metadata and documentation. An added advantage of publishing documentation and metadata is that these documents can be referred to in the methods sections of research articles, where the scope for detailed description is limited.</p>
            <p>When research publications are written, authors should ensure that basic information about the survey &#x2013; such as the parameters used in our inventory &#x2013; is included. Authors should preferably also indicate where more detailed information is available. Information on data availability ought to be included regardless of whether the publication appears in a journal with a policy on data availability statements.
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN6">6</xref>
                </sup>
            </p>
            <p>Survey items on migration aspirations are extremely sensitive to the exact wording, and analyses should therefore quote the question and response alternatives for key variables. This seems obvious, perhaps, but is often disregarded. Engaging actively with the wording of survey items helps ensure consistency between the data and the text. Publications should not refer to migration &#x2018;desires&#x2019; or &#x2018;intentions&#x2019;, for instance, if the relevant survey item was phrased in terms of consideration or expectation. Similarly, publications should not infer 
                <italic toggle="yes">likelihood</italic> to migrate from survey data on migration aspirations. Such misinterpretations are surprisingly widespread.</p>
            <p>Regardless of the potential for better practice, the wealth of existing data represents promising opportunities now that an overview has been compiled. Information about existing data helps carry out secondary analyses, make new surveys more cost-effective, and add comparative dimensions to analyses. The inventory of surveys on migration aspirations seeks to stimulate such gains.</p>

            <p>SUMMARY</p>
            <p> This study introduces a comprehensive inventory of surveys examining migration aspirations, plans, and intentions dating back to the 1960s. It provides essential details such as geographic focus, data collection periods, survey population, and methodologies employed. Highlighting the significance of understanding migration aspirations (used as an umbrella term) through survey data, it emphasizes their role in complementing the comprehension of migration processes and urges exploration beyond actual migration motivations. Furthermore, it underscores the relevance of migration aspirations in policy-making, particularly in addressing migration-related challenges and establishing social policy priorities. The inventory's primary goal is to facilitate researchers in locating and reusing existing survey data while exposing patterns and biases that could inform improved data collection strategies.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The study reveals the diverse nature of quantitative datasets focusing on migration aspirations. Surveys typically involve single-round data collection at the sub-national level, predominantly in Europe or Central Asia. They primarily target the general adult population using random or semi-random sampling and predominantly employ interview-based data collection methods. The article advocates for enhanced survey documentation, secure accessibility post-data collection, and detailed descriptions in research publications. It also stresses the significance of accurately citing survey questions and response options, avoiding misinterpretation of survey data. Moreover, it encourages the utilization of existing survey data for secondary analyses, cost-effective survey designs, and comprehensive comparative studies.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> GENERAL ASSESSMENT</p>
            <p> This article is an extremely welcome exercise aimed ultimately at maximizing reuse of existing data by first giving it the visibility it needs (and currently lacks). More specifically, it extensively explores existing quantitative surveys on migration aspirations, delving into their significance, diversity, and implications. The resulting systematic inventory serves as an invaluable resource for researchers in the field, offering a comprehensive understanding of survey practices. Notably, the article raises crucial points regarding documentation standards in survey research, pinpointing areas for enhancement and suggesting practical solutions. Its conclusions provide clear and actionable recommendations for researchers, emphasizing detailed survey documentation, accurate data interpretation, and effective referencing, thus guiding future studies in this domain. The emphasis on leveraging existing data and datasets on migration aspirations for secondary analyses and comparative studies showcases the authors' forward-thinking approach, promoting resourceful use of available information.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> FURTHER SUGGESTIONS</p>
            <p> The authors mostly focus on the geographic scope, the target population and methodologies used, while giving only a few hints with respect to the survey items operationalizing the umbrella term of &#x2018;migration aspirations&#x2019;. A separate publication is planned to focus specifically on the various dimensions of such aspirations that different surveys measure via various items. However, by separating the two exercises, the ambition of the review is somewhat limited, as geographic or temporal patterns cannot be connected to dimensions of migration aspirations that are measured, which is a missed opportunity. More generally, even within the scope of this review, it may have been interesting to uncover some relationships: e.g. surveys in sub-Saharan Africa target mainly which types of population with which methods and with which methods? &#x00a0;</p>
            <p> In addition, two aspects warrant attention for their unexpected nature. Firstly, the inclusion of 'residential mobility' within the category of migration aspirations is somewhat surprising, as it diverges from the conventional focus in migration literature.</p>
            <p> Secondly, the incorporation of surveys among migrant populations introduces a particular dimension. Unlike surveys targeting non-migrants, these inquiries delve into aspirations to return or move onwards implicitly, and hence go beyond the typical focus on initial migration aspirations. This distinction adds complexity to the analysis of targeted populations which could be further explored. Furthermore, it could be interesting to examine whether different dimensions of migration aspirations (preference vs. consideration vs. intention) are then used in surveys that measure aspirations for onward/return migration.</p>
            <p> A more explicit exploration of the rationale behind these two choices would contribute to a deeper understanding of the study's methodology and enrich the overall narrative.</p>
            <p>If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?</p>
            <p>Not applicable</p>
            <p>Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it engage with the current literature?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Are all the source data and materials underlying the results available?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Reviewer Expertise:</p>
            <p>Migration aspirations, Staying preferences, Immobility, Determinants of migration, Implications of (imm)mobility</p>
            <p>I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.</p>
