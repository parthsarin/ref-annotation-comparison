                <p>In this paper, we perform a comparative analysis of business models used by Energy Service Companies (ESCOs), suitable for the deployment of energy efficiency measures in the commercial rented sector across Europe. These models can effectively contribute to solving the split-incentive issue that arises in the rented building scenario. Some of them are obtained from their &#x201c;traditional&#x201d; counterparts, which do not consider the rented scenario, but just a bipartite agreement between an Energy Service Company and its client. The EU Horizon 2020 project SmartSPIN (Smart energy services to solve the SPlit INcentive problem in the commercial rented sector) targets delivery of enhanced energy services for commercial rented sector. These enhanced energy services (a) combine demand management services and energy efficiency interventions, (b) facilitate the adoption of renewables, (c) optimize the balance between demand and supply, (d) alleviate the split incentive issue. The pilot implementation of project will be performed in a business park in Greece, in an office building in Ireland and in two shopping centers in Spain. Key recommendations toward the implementation of such a smart energy service are provided in this paper. They have been obtained from a detailed analysis of ten interviews of key stakeholders of the energy efficiency section and of the commercial rented sector, along with an analysis of a selection of the most relevant technical literature.</p>

            <title>1. Introduction</title>
            <p>The split incentive issue is a key challenge to the deployment of energy efficiency measures in commercial rented buildings across Europe (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-19">Castellazzi 
                    <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). This situation arises because those parties who pay the energy bills (and that enjoy the energy savings) are different from those who make investment decisions. In (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-45">Nie 
                    <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2020</xref>) two types of split incentive are considered: investment split incentives and behaviour split incentives. The former may hinder investment decisions in energy efficiency measures, whereas the latter may hinder behaviours which determine a lower energy consumption. The split incentives in the U.S. commercial rented market were analysed in (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-36">Jessoe 
                    <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). It was found that 20% of tenants rent space in commercial buildings with electricity included into their monthly rent. Such a type of contract structure determines an incentive to over-consume energy (behavioural split-incentives) because electricity&#x2019;s marginal price is zero for tenants. The remaining 80% of tenants pay their own monthly utility bills, which will reduce the incentive for building owners to invest in energy efficiency measures, if they cannot increase the rent premium to fund the interventions to improve energy efficiency (investment split-incentives). The four possible cases with respect to split-incentives in the commercial rented sector are summarized in 
                <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Furthermore, the fact that tenants do not know for how long they will rent the current commercial units is creating an uncertainty regarding the rent income for the landlords, which may affect the decisions of investing in energy efficiency measures. The issue is sometimes referred to as temporal split incentive (

            <p>It is worth noting that works in a rented space require the landlord's consent, and a tenant can be reluctant to have any dealings with the landlord than strictly necessary, therefore in most cases a tenant will not ask the landlord energy efficiency improvements (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-9">Barton, 2014</xref>). Green leasing is the main instrument for both landlords and tenants to collaborate for achieving the common objective of improving energy efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions, and it can be considered as the first step toward overcoming the split-incentive issue (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-47">SmartSPIN D3.3, 2022</xref>). In a green lease, either the landlord or the tenant might assume a paternalistic role, wishing to force at some extent the other party to collaborate for achieving certain "green" goals, whereas a better-balanced relationship would enable to set out mutual objectives in the lease in a collaborative manner (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-17">Brooks

            <p>A new business model is required to overcome the split incentive issue in the commercial sector in Europe and to unlock the opportunities for increasing energy efficiency and flexibility of many commercial buildings. A well-designed business model might trigger a much greater uptake of smart energy services deployed 
                <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> performance-based contracting throughout the commercial sector. The approach followed in this paper toward establishing an ESCO business model addressing the split incentive issue in the commercial sector, is the analysis of the traditional ESCO business models, which do not consider the rented situation and their extension to the rented scenario. These models are all based on the concept of Energy Performance Contracting (EPC; 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-29">European Commission, 2022</xref>), in which the ESCO guarantees that the package of energy efficiency measures delivered to the client will generate sufficient reductions in the energy bill of the client to repay the initial capital investment within the duration of the EPC. The EPC requires a robust measurement and verification (M&amp;V) methodology to verify that the predicted savings are obtained and includes some penalty clauses to compensate the client when the agreed savings are not obtained. The M&amp;V process must be precise and unbiased to create the trust required to sign an EPC contract and to avoid contractual disputes (

Different types of EPC exist, and they are linked with the underlying business models. Most common are Shared-savings, Guaranteed savings, Energy cost-trust, and Finance lease, which determine the division of the savings between the ESCO, and its client and the service delivered (

            <p>The H2020 SmartSPIN project aims to remove the barrier of the split incentive through an innovative business model that couples the contractual agreements between tenants, building owners and energy efficiency providers with technologies for energy monitoring, management and measurement and verification (M&amp;V). To increase transparency, credibility and persistence of savings, a new set of tools should be developed with the contribution of the whole value chain, including stakeholders of both the supply side (ESCOs, M&amp;V specialists, etc.) and the demand side (tenants, building owners 
                <italic toggle="yes">etc</italic>.).</p>
            <p>In June 2020, BASE, AGORIA, ANESE and Innoenergy in Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain using Horizon 2020 funding launched an Efficiency as a Service (EaaS) initiative. The project proposed a pay-per-use model allowing the end-customers to pay only for the service received, rather than the physical infrastructure or product required for its delivery. The costs of the installation and maintenance of the equipment delivering energy efficiency is recovered through periodic customer payments. The customer pays fixed-cost-per-unit of the energy efficient service used, such as euros per hours of lighting, cubic meter of compressed air, per ton of refrigeration (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-24">Efficiency as a Service Initiative, 2020</xref>). SmartSPIN will extend such approach to the commercial rented sector, overcoming the split-incentive issue and delivering EaaS to the rented properties.</p>
            <p>The development of an enhanced EaaS business model requires the analysis of the potential opportunities for energy efficiency, flexibility, and renewable energy deployment in different commercial building types (
                <italic toggle="yes">e.g</italic>., office, shopping center, sports facility

            <p>An initial service model was investigated, involving both landlords and tenants to deliver different packages of energy efficiency measures which can generate energy savings (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-4">SmartSPIN D2.4, 2022</xref>). The installation of no-cost and low-cost measures (that does not require permission from the landlord to perform substantial upgrade works) enables to accumulate energy savings which can be used by an ESCO to finance (partially or totally) more advanced energy conservation measures (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-3">Agrawal 
                    <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). The payment of a monthly, quarterly or annual fee by the tenant (that is linked, directly or indirectly, to the energy savings achieved on their utility bills) represents the revenue stream for the ESCO. This revenue stream can be used to reward the landlord according to the specific business model adopted, such as shared savings, guaranteed savings, combination of shared/guaranteed savings, Chaffee model,

                <title>3.1 Equipment lease</title>
                <p>An equipment lease is a contract signed between two parties, the owner of the asset and the user of the asset, which gives the right to the user to use the asset for a specific period, against a fixed amount paid to the owner of the asset (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-46">SmartSPIN D2.1, 2022</xref>). The equipment lease business model is represented in 
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>. Relevant examples are the solar-as-a-service (SaaS) model and the heat-as-a-service (HaaS) model. With the SaaS, the ESCO leases PV panels and is responsible for financing, installation and maintenance, offering a solar energy tariff and dealing with energy export agreements. The HaaS delivers heat with a certain level of comfort agreement and can work with district heat network or with heat pumps, with ESCOs leasing the infrastructure (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-18">Brown 
                        <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). In most cases, the service provider assumes the financial and the technical risk, which incentivizes routine maintenance of the equipment. In some variations of the model, the service provider couples the offering with performance guarantees. It is possible that the building owner finances the equipment installations; either the building owner acts as a lessor or the building owner is the one to get into a contact with a lessor. In this case, a pass-through clause is included into the landlord-tenant lease to allow the costs of the efficiency measures to be passed through to the tenant as incremental upcharge. It is worth noting that a power purchase agreement (PPA) may be a better alternative to an equipment lease if the building owner does not want to be responsible for ongoing maintenance costs (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-6">Alternative Energy Ireland, 2022</xref>). Leasing may increase corporate performance measured in terms of market value because investors generally consider it as a business model that can contribute to increase the company's value (

                <title>3.2 Shared savings business model</title>
                <p>With the shared savings business model, the ESCO shares the savings with the landlord (
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Both ESCO and landlord obtain a revenue stream from energy efficiency service delivered by the ESCO. The ESCO is responsible for designing, financing, and implementing the energy efficiency project, usually obtaining a fixed portion of the savings over a fixed period. The ESCO is also responsible for the verification of the savings during the contractual period. The tenant pays the fees for the energy efficiency service to the ESCO and enjoys non-energy benefits such as a renewed premise and lower carbon-dioxide emissions. The risks for the landlord related to the implementation of the energy efficiency projects are limited. The tenant also pays their own utility bills to the energy supplier. This is the most energy efficient solution, since it was found that the firms that pay their own utility bills consume about 3 percent less electricity annually than those ones whose utility bills are included into rents (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-60">Jessoe 
                        <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, energy savings may or may not be shared with the tenant, depending on the amount of reduction of the monthly energy bill with respect to the payment for the ESCO service (sharing of savings with the tenant are not shown in the Figure).</p>

                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). In such a case the ESCO is still responsible for designing and implementing the energy efficiency project but would leave the responsibility for financing it to the landlord. Also in this case, the tenant pays the fees for the energy efficiency service to the ESCO and a reduced bill to the energy supplier, thanks to the installation of energy efficiency measures. The landlord may secure a stable revenue stream at the price of having to directly liaise with a bank or another investor for the financing of the energy efficiency measures.</p>

                <p>An ESCO may offer a complete energy service including both energy supply and energy efficiency to a commercial rented facility. This business model is sometimes referred in the literature as Chaffee model (
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). In such a case, the ESCO is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the entire energy system of its customer. The ESCO has the opportunity of securing a substantial revenue stream getting all the savings if contractual targets are met. To achieve such goals (which are specified in the contract), the ESCO needs to manage and transform the customer&#x2019;s energy system and will self-finance the related upgrade projects. If the targets are not met, the ESCO will pay a compensation, which depends on the energy savings shortage. The landlord has a contract with the ESCO and pays for both energy provision and the energy efficiency. Rather than a revenue stream from the energy efficiency, the landlord enjoys a thorough energy service from the ESCO with favorable contractual conditions. Moreover, the landlord receives a payment from the tenant(s) for the energy expenses due to the energy consumption of the tenant.</p>

                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>), the energy savings of the EPC project taken by the ESCO as a guarantee allow ESCO to request financing from a lease company (lessor). The lessor will invest in the EPC project providing the necessary equipment to the ESCO, while retaining ownership of the equipment throughout the contract duration. The payments for the equipment are performed using the energy user's cost savings according to an agreed timetable. The ownership of the equipment is transferred to the energy user at the end of the contract. The main advantage for the ESCO is that lease payments are usually lower than loan payments, because depreciation and interest expenses associated with the purchase of the equipment should not apply (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-55">Weiss, 2003</xref>). Moreover, through the finance lease contract, the ESCO transfers the credit risk to the finance lease company (

                <title>3.6 Energy efficiency as a service business model</title>
                <p>The energy efficiency as a service (EEaaS) business model is based on the idea that the promotion and up-scaling of energy efficiency requires treating all relevant costs as operational costs. The rationale is that buildings are assets and most building owners have already borrowed against them. As a result, the balance sheets of the building owners are already too crowded to add new liabilities for energy retrofit capital. In its most basic form, the EEaaS model has the structure of 
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>. The EEaaS provider has an EPC with performance guarantees agreement with an ESCO/contractor, while receiving payments from the building user according to the achieved energy savings. Pay-for-performance rules and transactions govern the relationships of all the involved parties in the model. Since energy efficiency is determined by the characteristics of the equipment as much as by the way it is operated, it makes sense to link the consumers&#x2019; payments to the overall performance of the service, quantified as the difference between the actual energy consumption and the energy consumption had the relevant intervention and optimizations not taken place. This is particularly relevant when the energy retrofit includes upgrades for improved monitoring and control of the systems&#x2019; operation. EEaaS models incentivize active management and optimization: the greater the performance of the service, the higher the added value for the consumer and the payments to the service provider. With EEaaS, the energy efficiency provider owns the assets delivering energy efficiency; therefore, there is no assets or liability added to the building owner&#x2019;s balance sheet (

                <p>An energy service agreement (ESA) is a variant of EPC that provides integrated financing of energy saving measures along with a long-term performance guarantee. A Managed Energy Services Agreement (MESA) model integrates the ESA model providing the energy saving improvements with the EaaS model providing the final energy service (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-18">Brown 
                        <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Under a MESA agreement, the MESA provider acts as an intermediary between the consumer and the utility by assuming the responsibility for the utility bills and charging the customer for both the actual energy consumed and the estimated energy savings due to the energy efficiency measures. In rented buildings the service provider directly passes the charges through to tenants (
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>). Since the EEaaS providers pay for and own the equipment, they face the risk of the building being left without tenancy. One way to mitigate this risk is by treating an energy efficiency upgrade as an option that has both a cost to acquire (the cost of the upgrade) and the capability to produce value when utilized by the tenant. When the model is operational, the added value that is generated for the tenant should cover the cost to acquire. In the case of tenancy interruption, the building owner must have agreed to pay to the provider a minimum fee for making the efficiency upgrade available in the first place.</p>

                <p>&#x2022;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;The building owner offers the building spaces and functions for the installation of the energy efficiency measures.</p>
                <p>&#x2022;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;The MEETS service provider pays for and maintains the measures in the building, and in return, has a long-term agreement to exploit the value of the energy savings. MEETS uses the term 
                    <italic toggle="yes">energy tenant</italic> to highlight the acquired right to harvest the added value of the energy efficiency upgrades. For this right, the service provider pays the building owner rent for using the site. These payments are an additional rental income for the building owner.</p>
                <p>&#x2022;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;The energy tenant delivers to the utility the yield from the metered energy efficiency (energy savings due to the upgrades).</p>
                <p>&#x2022;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;The utility bills the building, at retail, for both actual consumption and metered efficiency. As in the on-bill-repayment case, the utility is actively involved by offering its billing system for the charging the tenants and redistributing the value to the service provider.</p>
                <p>The main reason for utilities to participate in a MEETS scheme is the opportunity to buy energy savings (like a PPA for energy efficiency) and comply with energy efficiency obligations that are imposed on them in the framework of Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive.</p>
                <p>&#x2022;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;Part of the financial benefits can be used for incentivizing the tenants to avoid behaviours that lead to the deterioration of the energy efficiency measures.</p>
                <p>&#x2022;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;The building owner treats the energy efficiency improvements the same way other conventional tenant improvements are treated. At the conclusion of the agreement with the service provider, the improvements become property of the building owner, free of debt or other financial liability. The MEETS model is summarized in

                <p>An important observation from MEETS initiatives in the USA is that third-party lenders are willing to engage only if the utility is a proper counterparty, instead of it just passing through the collected payments for metered efficiency. In other words, the utility should treat consumption and metered efficiency in the same way: if any of the respective parts of the bill are not paid, the utility has the right to stop the energy supply to the building.</p>

It can be observed that in Ireland, Spain and Greece the ESCO markets are not mature yet.

                    <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) are also in agreement with our stakeholders&#x2019; analysis. Barriers to the ESCOs&#x2019; services obviously also hinder the adoption of the most advanced business models previously reviewed in the considered countries. It is unlikely that business models where an ESCO needs to liaise with other actors, such as another energy efficiency provider (
                <xref ref-type="other" rid="s3">section 3.6</xref>, 
                <xref ref-type="other" rid="s3.7">section 3.7</xref>, 
                <xref ref-type="other" rid="s3.8">section 3.8</xref>) may be given full consideration by actors who lack experience and by potential clients who mistrust ESCOs. Therefore, it is unlikely that such business models will be successful in Ireland, Spain and Greece in the short term and will not be selected for SmartSPIN&#x2019;s demonstration. With a maturation of the ESCO markets in Europe and in the considered countries, new market opportunities might arise when utility companies will co-create value connecting supply-side ESCOs with potential demand-side customers, keeping a customer-centric, service-dominant approach (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-8">Badi, 2021</xref>). The comparative evaluation of the considered business models is presented in 
                <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>. The guaranteed savings model in 
                <xref ref-type="other" rid="s3.3">section 3.3</xref> seems the most suitable one to be adopted for the demonstration activities of the H2020 SmartSPIN project (with some changes). With such a model, the ESCO may concentrate on the achievement of energy savings and delivering them with performance guarantee. In relation to project financing, it was found that the pilot companies involved in the SmartSPIN project have established sinking funds by setting aside revenue over a suitable period of time to fund the future capital expense or repayment of a long-term debt for the implementation of energy efficiency measures. This facilitates the engagement and contracting with ESCOs that prefer to work with a guaranteed savings business model, leaving to their clients the responsibility of project funding. In fact, banks evaluate borrowers mainly on their creditworthiness, without being able to assess the actual capacity of an energy efficiency project to create energy savings and cash flows. The loan can be paid back by the cash flows generated by the project only in case of some large-scale projects (

                    <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). In addition, a demand response service may be established and managed by the ESCO, which will contribute to add economic value to the energy savings achieved with the efficiency measures and in turn to a higher value shared with the clients (

            <p>The smart energy service can be delivered in two steps. The first step requires the engagement of the tenant for the implementation of energy management measures and the installation of energy efficient equipment and energy efficiency measures (EEMs) owned by the tenant. The second step requires the engagement of the landlord and obtaining their consent for implementation of other EEMs and upgrades to the building which require substantial works. The service can be delivered using a tripartite EPC with two guarantee periods, if necessary (
                <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Figure 10</xref>). The same steps characterize each period: an energy audit, the planning of EEMs, their implementation with upgrade works, the monitoring of performances and the possibility of repeating such steps if the desired performances are not achieved with the selected package of EEMs. It is foreseeable that the EEMs installed in the first step are simpler than those installed in the second step, therefore they result in a lower energy cost reduction and lower implementation costs (
                <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 11</xref>). The energy cost savings obtained with the first step (taken from the ESCO) can be partially used to finance the EEMs installed in the second step.</p>

            <p>Finally, it is worth noting that the literature has shown that buildings&#x2019; occupants tend to use more energy than expected after retrofits, which also results in underestimated retrofitting costs. This is known as rebound effect. It was recommended in (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-39">Lu 
                    <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2017</xref>) to reduce such a rebound effect by sharing part of the savings with the tenant. The paper presented a model to evaluate the Net-Present-Value of an energy efficiency project for the building owner at different contract durations and sharing percentages with tenant. However, the analysis presented in (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-39">Lu 
                    <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2017</xref>) assumes that the rebound effect can be modelled by means of an exponential function called standard utility function. Standard utility function is described by three parameters, the risk tolerance (which determines the curvature of the function and can be used to differentiate risk attitudes of various renters) and two other constants defining the boundary conditions. The main limitation of the study is that the validation of the proposed model using data gathered from the field (including the correct estimation of its parameters) would require several campaigns to collect a large amount of data, which cannot be easily delivered by a single project. Moreover, tenants may have a low preference for green building features with respect to rental rate, convenience of tenant operations, safety and security the study (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1">Adnan 
                    <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). This indicates that sharing of savings with tenants is a necessary catalyst to stimulate their interest in green buildings and energy efficiency.</p>

            <title>6. Conclusions</title>
            <p>This paper has analyzed eight ESCO business models to deliver energy efficiency through smart energy services to the commercial rented sector and the driving factors, which may enable to overcome the split incentive issue and to enter in an effective tripartite EPC agreement involving building owner, tenant and ESCO. Furthermore, the features of a smart energy service suitable for the commercial sector have been investigated by means of interviews with key stakeholders and the literature. The proposed SmartSPIN service will comprise several features: energy management, change of the electricity supplier, equipment or renewable energy source installation (
                <italic toggle="yes">e.g</italic>., solar PV installations) or replacement, installation of sensors, energy monitoring, operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) services, providing advice on how to reduce energy consumption, etc. These features will be delivered ensuring benefits for all the involved parties. The SmartSPIN service will have to be delivered in a manner which will consider the existing relationship between landlord and tenant. If the landlord owns all the equipment installed in the rented unit, the ESCO could engage with landlord only. However, if tenants are allowed to install their own equipment and own some parts that can be replaced with more energy efficient counterparts, then the ESCO will engage with them as well. This is the most general case that must be addressed by the SmartSPIN service.</p>
            <p>EaaS include five major benefits: energy management, maintenance, total guarantee of the equipment, improvement works, and improvement of energy efficiency. Exceptions may apply for specific cases and obviously, the service must be flexible to cover the cases where not all the mentioned benefits apply. A trusted and standardized Measurement and Verification (M&amp;V) approach will be developed to determine the energy savings applicable to the various features of the SmartSPIN service. The M&amp;V process must address all the concerns in relation to the level of uncertainty associated with the measurements. The lack of a trusted M&amp;V process may become a barrier to the deployment of the energy efficiency service. The SmartSPIN service should include, where applicable, a dynamic tariff for the electricity, gas consumption and water used by the tenants, which is fair, easy to understand and independent of the season.</p>
            <p>The SmartSPIN smart energy service will be delivered using a guaranteed savings business model, which has been adapted to the rented scenario to solve the split incentive issue. It is also proposed to adapt the standard EPC to the rented scenario for the commercial sector, establishing a tripartite agreement between landlord, tenant and ESCO which represents the legal/contractual framework required to deliver benefits deriving from energy efficiency to all the parties.</p>

        <body>
            <p>The present study conducted a comparative analysis of business models used by ESCOs, contributing to dealing with split-incentive issues to develop a new ESCO business model. The study also provided recommendations for enhanced energy service in the commercial sector, and the proposed model was implemented in Greece, Ireland, and Spain. The present study's main flaw is using the research method for comparative business models. The following comments would improve the acceptability of the present research.</p>

            <p> </p>
            <p> Please dedicate a paragraph to contributions. The contributions of the study are not clear or hard to follow.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The article's structure should be presented at the end of the introduction.</p>

                <bold>Methods</bold>
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Surprisingly, there is no clear information regarding the research steps. For instance, which features of business models were considered in comparative analysis? How did the authors interview the experts? How did the authors validate the collected data through interviews? Overall, the research method's steps should be explained clearly and followed quickly by readers. It is recommended to provide a flow chart illustrating the research steps. Also, the authors should explain why they implemented the proposed business model in Greece, Ireland, and Spain.</p>

            </p>
            <p> This is an interview study comparing and contrasting eight ESCO business models, aimed at the goal of overcoming split incentive issues in the commercial rented sector across Europe. After qualitative discussion of the benefits and barriers to each ESCO business model, the authors validated the models in three demonstration sites: Spain, Greece, and Ireland. Overall, this paper could be improved by a more rigorous assessment of the interview data. Furthermore, the &#x201c;validation&#x201d; method for the three demonstration sites also lacks empirical grounding and the resulting recommendations for an enhanced energy service in the commercial sector are tenuous. I believe this paper needs substantial improvements before publication.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> My general comments follow, preceding my section-by-section comments.</p>

                        <p>The paper could use a final check for grammar and spelling (e.g., &#x201c;They have been obtained from a detailed analysis of ten interviews of key stakeholders of the energy efficiency section and of the commercial rented sector&#x2026;&#x201d; It should read &#x201c;energy efficiency sector&#x201d;).</p>

                        <p>I would explain the validation method in the abstract. It currently reads as though the paper is referencing existing projects in Spain, Greece, and Ireland &#x2013; rather than hypotheticals.</p>

                        <p>The authors might consider providing a bit more context about how energy investments are often studied at the individual- or organization-level. These two contexts aren&#x2019;t exactly described in this literature review. Furthermore, the split-incentive issue sometimes arises in the middle of the Venn-Diagram (e.g., individual renters butting up against building managers/owners).</p>
