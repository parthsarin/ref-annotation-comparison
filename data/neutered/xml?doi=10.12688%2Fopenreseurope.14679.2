                    </bold> IPM Resource Toolbox (Toolbox) has been developed as an interactive, online repository of integrated pest management (IPM) resources. Populated with high priority resources for farmers and their advisors during the project, its structure enables additional resources added over time. The repository is a public interactive website, available to anyone looking to access, understand, and implement IPM. Built on an open-source content management system, the toolbox is designed to require minimal post-production site maintenance and support, while being easily expanded to integrate resources from future initiatives.</p>
                <p>To ensure an efficient but comprehensive website design, population, maintenance, a survey of target user needs was conducted. Different type of IPM stakeholders, both internal and external to the IPMworks project, ranked the key requirements for the Toolbox, such as practical information about diseases and pests&#x2019; management and economic thresholds: 343 feedbacks and answers from a survey of 10 questions, carried out across Europe in four languages, provided the key elements and foundation for the IPM Resource Toolbox website development and specification.The Toolbox resources are explained in different languages, with images, divided by topics, with the possibility to find additional details and accessible by smartphone. </p>

            <p>Intensive use of pesticides has led to many problems such as resistance to agro-chemicals, reduction of natural enemies&#x2019; and non-target organisms&#x2019; population, and rise of chemical residues in final products (

                    <italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>), all contributing to a general increase of production costs. Modern agriculture strives to achieve more sustainable farming systems, with less reliance on pesticides.  The challenge of reducing inputs applied in fields and reducing the negative effects on the environment, while retaining a high quality and quantity of the final yield, preserving, or increasing farmers&#x2019; incomes is complicated but achievable (

                    <italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2012</xref>). To face these issues integrated production was developed, aiming to reach a high-quality production by giving the priority to ecological methods. In this context integrated pest management (IPM) aims to achieve a sustainable crop protection against harmful organisms, keeping the use of chemical pesticides at levels that are economically and environmentally acceptable. In fact, the adequate and safe use of Plant Protection Products (PPP) within IPM program remains a key component and also many projects (such as TOPPS 
                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.topps-life.org/#">http://www.topps-life.org/#</ext-link>) provided great efforts to reduce losses during pesticide applications. In Europe IPM became mandatory in 2014 (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-7">Directive 2009/128/EC</xref>) and the European Union is progressively banning or limiting the most dangerous pesticides for human health and environment and today is embedded into the &#x201c;Farm to Fork&#x201d; strategy (

            <p>Agricultural production inevitably becomes more complicated over time, as new innovations in plant breeding, machinery, application technology, management systems, require more time and knowledge to identify suitable approaches and integrate them into existing approaches. Increasing the system complexity therefore increases the benefits of methods, tools, and thresholds to decide if, when, where and what kind of intervention should be carried out, based on updated and detailed information about crops and diseases in a specific context (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-25">Rossi 
                    <italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2012</xref>). Different tools are already available to help farmers in managing pests, such as warning service, on site device and decision support systems (DSS). Even if these tools provide updated information about weather conditions and forecast, crop growth and risks of key pests/disease at regional or farm level (

                    <italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2012</xref>), DSSs and other resources still have a limited uptake among farmers due to a range of actual and perceived barriers, such as farmers not being aware of what resources are available, or resources (such as pest forecast systems) focusing on individual pests while farmers are facing multiple infestations across the farm. IPM resources should satisfy users&#x2019; need in the real field context and demonstrate the economic advantage of their adoption.</p>
            <p>To fully implement IPM principles a holistic approach is needed, involving the application of different strategies to optimize pests&#x2019; control, considering economic and environmental thresholds (

                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-27">Stenberg, 2017</xref>). However, in many cases the results of IPM research and innovation projects are difficult to be applied by farmers. They perceive IPM as time consuming, and the application of multiple control strategies against different pests is hard in the field context, where different crops require different interventions (

A lack of knowledge and understanding of IPM principles can lead to increased confidence in pesticide efficacy, thus farmers&#x2019; education to IPM principles is crucial to make them able to evaluate pesticides, their effects, and make appropriate decisions (

Many European initiatives, such as IPMWorks (H2020, No. 101000339), IPMDecisions (H2020 No. 817617), SmartProtect (H2020 No. 862563) and Innoseta (H2020 no. 773864) are promoting the adoption of IPM strategies and available tools across Europe to achieve more sustainable farming and plant protection. These fixed term projects develop resources to support advance implementation of IPM towards &#x2018;Holistic IPM&#x2019;. Providing access to resource, training, technical support, and demonstrations of IPM in action and the consequence of their management on the environment improves uptake and implementation (

            <p>One objective of the 
                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ipmworks.net/">IPMWORKS</ext-link> project is to develop a Resource Toolbox to provide easy access to IPM resources to different stakeholders, making IPM Resources widely accessible in a consistent format across Europe, promoting improved uptake of effective IPM tactics and strategies. This Toolbox is an interactive, online repository of IPM resources, populated with high priority resources for farmers and their advisors during the project, with further resources added over time. The repository is an interactive website with a dedicated search engine, accessed by both consortium members and the public. The website is built on an open-source content management system, requiring minimal post-production site maintenance and support to ensure longevity. This toolbox enables users to easily search, share, and discuss IPM resources. Resources will include training modules, results of demonstration trials, leaflets describing cost-effective IPM strategies, videos of farmers&#x2019; testimonies and demonstration events, training materials, DSS (from 
                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ipmdecisions.net/">IPMDecisions</ext-link>), cultural control descriptions, and material to evaluate the success of the adopted practices. Resources collated in other EC funded projects can be readily integrated, such as for IPM resources within the

            <p>To ensure an efficient but comprehensive website design a survey of target user needs was conducted.

Firstly, the survey asks general information about users, such as the country where they live, which crop they are interested in, and to which group they belong. Almost 90% of respondents were farmers, agronomists and researchers, minimizing the risk of bias from a &#x201c;single perspective&#x201d; (

Then, the survey asks about the actual approach they use for crop management, what they expect from IPM toolbox and what could encourage their use of toolbox. Finally, the survey asks what can be improved on the website and if they know some European projects. The survey collected mainly quantitative data, where users could select the answer among multiple choices or using a Likert scale.  No personal data was collected in the survey, all responses were anonymous, and questions could be left blank, considering missing data as indifference or lack of opinion by respondents.

                <p>Most respondents weren&#x2019;t aware of the suggested projects. Researchers together with developers and policy makers were most aware of past and current projects, but among these groups only 25&#x2013;30% of them know some projects. On the other hand, among farmers, advisors, supply chain workers, only few know of past and present projects (6&#x2013;11%) (
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>). This means that a deep revision in how projects&#x2019; topics, goals and results are communicated to a broad audience is needed. As suggested by

                <p>Stakeholders indicated some improvements to make the IPM toolbox more usable. Considering the accessibility, being a platform available across Europe, contents should be expressed in users&#x2019; native languages (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-3">Barzman

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-8">Ehler, 2006</xref>; 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-19">Lefebvre

Contents should be clear, easy to find and tailored to each farm context, describing only the essential and providing recommendations. Information and resources should require minimal clicks to be found in the site, with contents divided into topics and expressed in the simplest way possible, especially if they are about technical aspects. Moreover, stakeholders would like to find easily links to other existing platforms and to have the possibility to read scientific articles about the main topics. Users that have access to scientifical papers, researchers&#x2019; results, or participate to events, are more likely to adopt IPM strategies (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-20">McNamara 
                        <italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 1991</xref>), but most of time scientifical results, articles or congress are not open to farmers, advisors etc. (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-14">Hoffmann 
                        <italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2007</xref>). Considering the technical contents, final users suggested that they should cover a wider range of pests, diseases and beneficial organisms and they should follow the ongoing of the season, because farmers normally face much more issues compared to what is present in the platforms. Farmers need practical information, in fact toolbox should express technical content in a simple way, targeted to implementation, and minimizing theorical contents. If resources are context specific, as related to a region, a variety, or a soil type, it should be clarified.</p>
                <p>Most users were interested in the current and future European projects, and they would like to receive news about these. Particularly, H2020 DiverIMPACTS project is developing a Toolbox to find the most relevant resources for users, according to their need, and to encourage the diversification in the agricultural sector for both technical aspects and sector development. Finally, about 96% of respondents were interested in finding out more about IPMworks online IPM Resources Toolbox, confirming the great attention that agricultural stakeholders deserve to research and innovation, especially in the last years (

                <p>The Toolbox was developed following the information collected during the abovementioned survey, following users&#x2019; suggestions and feedbacks. The

No login requirement was planned: on the contrary, the available resources are highlighted, and users can search them freely.</p>

The toolbox also gives the possibility to upload images and other resources, and to add further information as a link to the original website, DOI, institutional contacts, email, etc. All the uploaded information must be approved by a team member before being available for public.</p>
                <p>Once the resource of interest is found, users can click and see more details about the topic. An example is reported in

            <title>Conclusions</title>
            <p>Target users expect the Toolbox to provide quick access to descriptions of IPM resources, and associated training on how to implement those resources. They want the information to be easily accessible, but also be able to see further details wherever available. Users indicated a preference for image-based content, but other formats were all acceptable. Survey was the starting point to understand better what stakeholders need, to create a useful Toolbox, designed for users. The toolbox will be an important tool for spread the adoption of IPM principles across Europe.</p>
            <p>The toolbox enables stakeholders to both access existing resources, and share their own outputs, with peers from across Europe.</p>

            <p>In general, the study is a comprehensive overview of the outcomes and activities within the IPMWorks H2020 project. The overall approach and the general concept are quite interesting and helpful towards the wider adoption of integrated pest management and the challenges. The quality is clearly very good.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Some minor comments can be found below in order to further improve the quality of the manuscript and avoid confusion:

                    <list-item>
                        <p>In the abstract and introduction, it would have been nice to provide the number of stakeholders.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>Furthermore, the role of pesticides as an important part of IPM should be also mentioned in order to highlight the importance of their sustainable use.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>The eight principles of IPM could be also mentioned.</p>

                    <list-item>
                        <p>In the methodology section, it would be helpful to specify the number of questions per survey.</p>

                    <list-item>
                        <p>Furthermore, authors are encouraged to justify the number of the sample and to show that such a number (119 in total) can be adequate for some conclusions.</p>

                    <list-item>
                        <p>The quality of the figures is very good, with only a recommendation to increase their size.</p>

                    <list-item>
                        <p>As a general comment, it could be said that the authors could further highlight the novelty of the project and platform and discuss both the differences revealed between the several categories of stakeholders and the potential utility of their overall approach and project.</p>

                <p>The Authors are extremely grateful to Reviewers who took time to read and comment our paper. We addressed mostly all the comments and suggestion both directly in the text and in the rebuttal letter below (our responses in 
                    <italic>italics</italic>).</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> 
                    <bold>#Reviewer 2</bold> In general, the study is a comprehensive overview of the outcomes and activities within the IPMWorks H2020 project. The overall approach and the general concept are quite interesting and helpful towards the wider adoption of integrated pest management and the challenges. The quality is clearly very good.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> Some minor comments can be found below in order to further improve the quality of the manuscript and avoid confusion:</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> In the abstract and introduction, it would have been nice to provide the number of stakeholders.</p>
                <p> 
                    <italic>Done.</italic>
                </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> Furthermore, the role of pesticides as an important part of IPM should be also mentioned in order to highlight the importance of their sustainable use.</p>
                <p> 
                    <italic>Done.</italic>
                </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> The eight principles of IPM could be also mentioned.</p>
                <p> 
                    <italic>Honestly, we believe that the link to the official EU website </italic>

                    </ext-link>
                    <italic> and the citations of three reference papers is quite enough to give a comprehensive explanation to the reader.</italic>
                </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> In the methodology section, it would be helpful to specify the number of questions per survey. 
                    <italic>Done.</italic>
                </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> Furthermore, authors are encouraged to justify the number of the sample and to show that such a number (119 in total) can be adequate for some conclusions.</p>
                <p> 
                    <italic>Actually, the total number of respondents were 343. Unfortunately the EU projects have some clear and strict timeline and deadlines so it was not possible to wait longer so to increase the number of respondents.</italic>
                </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> The quality of the figures is very good, with only a recommendation to increase their size.</p>
                <p> 
                    <italic>We followed ORE requirements, by the way it is possible to download the figures both as ppt and pdf.</italic>

            <p>The manuscript gives an overview of the excellent and useful work done within IPMWORKS EU project. The idea, objective and results seem really interesting and useful for the improvement of implementation of IPM all around Europe.</p>

                        <p>The authors indicate twice in the abstract that the survey was conducted in "multiple languages." I suggest that once is enough. It may also be interesting to point out the number of European countries through which the survey has circulated.</p>

                    <list-item>
                        <p>Instead of saying "different stakeholders", I would say the number of stakeholders consulted.</p>

                    <list-item>
                        <p>IPM and its implementation became mandatory in EU since January 2014. So, theoretically, after 8 years of the entry in force, these practices should be already fully implemented all around Europe. Then, projects and actions as IPM Works and other mentioned in this article should not be needed. The problem is that, after 8 years of the mandatory success in EU of IPM has been very low. Authors should include some objective information about the results of conducted official audits of SUD implementation among EU members, and difficulties encountered on the implementation of IPM.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>Additionally, even if the introduction chapter is adequate, it seems that the use of Plant Protection Products within IPM program has been forgotten by the authors. PPP and its adequate and safe use is one of the measures included in IPM and there is a large list of EU projects, some of them similar to IPM WORKS including developed freely accessible platforms, to help farmers in the complex process of PPP application. I suggest authors should at least include some of these important actions conducted already in Europe.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>The problems mentioned ('resistance to agro-chemicals, reduction of natural enemies' and non-target organisms' population, and rise of chemical residues in final products') are absolutely true, but given the great efforts that are being made to reduce losses during pesticide applications, I suggest some additional comment in this regard (airborne spray drift, ground losses).</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>"In Europe IPM became mandatory in 2014 (Directive 2009/128/EC)" I suggest linking this with the current European strategy "From Farm to Fork".</p>

                    <list-item>

                    <list-item>
                        <p>I would say "Agricultural production inevitably becomes more complicated over time, as new innovations in plant breeding, machinery, application technology, and management systems require more time..."</p>

                        <p>"DSSs and other resources still have a limited uptake among farmers due to a range of actual and perceived barriers, such as farmers not being aware of what resources are available" I suggest adding that efforts are still being made from Europe to correct this, such as the H2020 Innoseta project or the BTSF courses of the European Commission.</p>

                        <p>In the additional comments&#x2019; chapter, it has been written that &#x201c;being a platform available across Europe, contents should be expressed in user&#x2019;s native languages&#x201d;. Of course, this is obvious and there are already different platforms available in different languages.</p>

                        <p>Given that farmers are the end user of this application (119), may the authors say where the responses have mainly come from (the 3 countries with the most surveys)? This is important, given the degree of heterogeneity within European agriculture.</p>

                        <p>119 answers from farmers, considering the participation of 17 countries, seems a very poor number and, consequently, difficult to extract conclusions about the opinion of EU farmers. It represents an average of 7 farmers/country. This value cannot be acceptable to extract conclusions. The same comment can be applied for the rest of stakeholder&#x2019;s groups.</p>

                        <p>"Most of them expected it to be an interactive platform (40% of farmers and agronomists and 70% of researchers)" - That's almost double! Why do you think there is this difference?</p>

                    <list-item>
                        <p>Figures 3-5. I don't quite appreciate how many different shades of blue there are. I have counted, if I am not mistaken, four. This is confusing to me, since the bars indicate the percentages of a survey that range from 1 to 5. I suggest a clearer bar system or at least include the blue scale from 1 to 5.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>I ask myself a question. Respondents indicated that they wanted a tool that above all else was simple, clear, in their native language, and with more images than text. However, this is already being implemented in most DSSs today. Why do these communication problems still occur between the latest advances in pesticide management and application and end users?</p>
                    </list-item>
                </list> In general, there is too much text on the importance of survey and very little explanation about the platform itself. How the material has been organized, how users can easily (or not) find the information, which kind of materials are available, and other important practical information expected when a tool box platform is presented. Survey represents just the starting point but, in this article, it seems the core of the project.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Figure 7 is the only practical information of the platform and, unfortunately, due to its size, it is nearly impossible to read it. Also, the same comment is applied to Figure 8.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> In the conclusions it has been written: &#x201c;The toolbox will be an important tool for spread the adoption of IPM principles across Europe&#x201d;. Does it mean that platform is still under development? If it is already available, this sentence should be removed and, of course, a clear and direct link to the platform should be provided.</p>
            <p>Is the study design appropriate and does the work have academic merit?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?</p>
            <p>Not applicable</p>
            <p>Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?</p>
            <p>Partly</p>

            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>

                <p>The Authors are extremely grateful to Reviewers who took time to read and comment our paper. We addressed mostly all the comments and suggestion both directly in the text and in the rebuttal letter below (our responses in 
                    <italic>italics</italic>).</p>

                    <bold>#Reviewer 1</bold> The manuscript gives an overview of the excellent and useful work done within IPMWORKS EU project. The idea, objective and results seem really interesting and useful for the improvement of implementation of IPM all around Europe.</p>

                    <bold>Abstract</bold> What do you mean by &#x2018;internal and external stakeholders&#x2019;?</p>
                <p> 
                    <italic>We meant stakeholders both directly involved in IPMworks and not</italic>.&#x00a0;</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> The authors indicate twice in the abstract that the survey was conducted in "multiple languages." I suggest that once is enough. It may also be interesting to point out the number of European countries through which the survey has circulated.</p>
                <p> 
                    <italic>The survey was conducted in four languages (English, French, Italian and Dutch): modified in the abstract. The Survey circulated across all Europe, but we got responses from 20 countries (see figure 1).</italic>
                </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> Instead of saying "different stakeholders", I would say the number of stakeholders consulted.</p>
                <p> 
                    <italic>The total number of respondents were 343, but not all of them were growers: we received replies also from researchers, agronomists, policy makers, and plant protection organizations &#x2026; for these reasons we believe that &#x201c;different stakeholders&#x201d; is better describing the different sources. In any case, we adjusted the abstract in order to be much clearer. Please see also table 1 for more details.</italic>

                    <bold>Introduction</bold> IPM and its implementation became mandatory in EU since January 2014. So, theoretically, after 8 years of the entry in force, these practices should be already fully implemented all around Europe. Then, projects and actions as IPM Works and other mentioned in this article should not be needed. The problem is that, after 8 years of the mandatory success in EU of IPM has been very low. Authors should include some objective information about the results of conducted official audits of SUD implementation among EU members, and difficulties encountered on the implementation of IPM.</p>
                <p> 
                    <italic>Actually, the aim of the research project IPMworks and the toolbox developed is exactly about overpassing difficulties of application and spread of IPM techniques</italic>
                </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> &#x00a0;Additionally, even if the introduction chapter is adequate, it seems that the use of Plant Protection Products within IPM program has been forgotten by the authors. PPP and its adequate and safe use is one of the measures included in IPM and there is a large list of EU projects, some of them similar to IPM WORKS including developed freely accessible platforms, to help farmers in the complex process of PPP application. I suggest authors should at least include some of these important actions conducted already in Europe.&#x00a0;</p>

                <p> The problems mentioned ('resistance to agro-chemicals, reduction of natural enemies' and non-target organisms' population, and rise of chemical residues in final products') are absolutely true, but given the great efforts that are being made to reduce losses during pesticide applications, I suggest some additional comment in this regard (airborne spray drift, ground losses).</p>

                <p> &#x00a0;"DSSs and other resources still have a limited uptake among farmers due to a range of actual and perceived barriers, such as farmers not being aware of what resources are available" I suggest adding that efforts are still being made from Europe to correct this, such as the H2020 Innoseta project or the BTSF courses of the European Commission.</p>

                    <bold>Methods</bold> The sentence &#x201c;Almost 90% of respondents were farmers, agronomist and researchers, minimizing the risk of bias&#x201d; is unclear. How is the risk minimized?</p>
                <p> 
                    <italic>The idea was to avoid the creation of a top-down proposed platform: having 90% of answers from farmers made us confident of a bottom-up approach. Better clarified into the text.</italic>&#x00a0;</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> In the additional comments&#x2019; chapter, it has been written that &#x201c;being a platform available across Europe, contents should be expressed in user&#x2019;s native languages&#x201d;. Of course, this is obvious and there are already different platforms available in different languages.</p>
                <p> 
                    <italic>We agree.</italic>
                </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> How did you translate the tool into several languages? Who helped you? In IPMworks we are 35 Partners from all across EU.&#x00a0;
                    <italic>Everyone helped.</italic>
                </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> Given that farmers are the end user of this application (119), may the authors say where the responses have mainly come from (the 3 countries with the most surveys)? This is important, given the degree of heterogeneity within European agriculture.</p>
                <p> 
                    <italic>We think that Figure 1 is quite clear.</italic>
                </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> How many questions were there in total per survey?</p>
                <p> 
                    <italic>10 questions, some multiple choice and some using Likert scale.</italic>
                </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> "Microsoft Excel was used to manage data and to create graphs and tables" - and did the authors not use any other additional software to analyze the statistics of the data, such as R or SSPS?</p>
                <p> 
                    <italic>No.</italic>
                </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> 
                    <italic>Table 1:&#x00a0;</italic>119 answers from farmers, considering the participation of 17 countries, seems a very poor number and, consequently, difficult to extract conclusions about the opinion of EU farmers. It represents an average of 7 farmers/country. This value cannot be acceptable to extract conclusions. The same comment can be applied for the rest of stakeholder&#x2019;s groups.</p>
                <p> 
                    <italic>We can agree with this comment: nevertheless, EU funded Projects have a quite clear timeline and deadlines thus it was not possible to wait longer for obtaining more feedbacks. Moreover, yes, it is true that the farmers are the final &#x201c;practical&#x201d; users but more than often they are part of a network with other stakeholders (researchers, agronomists, retail organisations etc.) so the number to use is 343.</italic>
                </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> When the authors say "number of answers", do they mean the number of surveys? Or the number of questions answered?</p>
                <p> 
                    <italic>The number of surveys completed: clarified in the table.&#x00a0;</italic>&#x00a0;</p>

                <p> 
                    <bold>Results:</bold> "Most of them expected it to be an interactive platform (40% of farmers and agronomists and 70% of researchers)" - That's almost double! Why do you think there is this difference?</p>
                <p> 
                    <italic>Most probably a researcher is much more aware of what an interactive platform is and which type of advantages can provide.&#x00a0;</italic>
                </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> Figures 3-5. I don't quite appreciate how many different shades of blue there are. I have counted, if I am not mistaken, four. This is confusing to me, since the bars indicate the percentages of a survey that range from 1 to 5. I suggest a clearer bar system or at least include the blue scale from 1 to 5.</p>
                <p> 
                    <italic>The shades of blue are 5, unfortunately not all the five categories were always available (if no one scored &#x201c;1&#x201d; the darker colour is not present). A note has been added into the captions.&#x00a0;</italic>
                </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> I ask myself a question. Respondents indicated that they wanted a tool that above all else was simple, clear, in their native language, and with more images than text. However, this is already being implemented in most DSSs today. Why do these communication problems still occur between the latest advances in pesticide management and application and end users?
                    <italic>We don&#x2019;t have a definitive answer (unfortunately), nevertheless, most probably, it is due to the lack of &#x201c;bridge&#x201d; between research/innovation and practical agriculture. We hope that IPMworks, as well as many other initiatives, could shorten this gap. In general, there is too much text on the importance of survey and very little explanation about the platform itself. How the material has been organized, how users can easily (or not) find the information, which kind of materials are available, and other important practical information expected when a tool box platform is presented. Survey represents just the starting point but, in this article, it seems the core of the project. </italic> 
                    <italic>Actually, the platform is at the beginning of its life: it has been just structured and developed and it will be launched in October. In fact, this paper is about the development of the toolbox.</italic>
                </p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> Figure 7 is the only practical information of the platform and, unfortunately, due to its size, it is nearly impossible to read it. Also, the same comment is applied to Figure 8.</p>
                <p> 
                    <italic>As previously commented, this is just a &#x201c;preview&#x201d; of the toolbox. Nevertheless, due to ORE requirements the screenshots are at the maximum possible quality. If you download the pdf of the paper the shape is better. Sorry for that.</italic>
                </p>
                <p> In the conclusions it has been written: &#x201c;The toolbox will be an important tool for spread the adoption of IPM principles across Europe&#x201d;. Does it mean that platform is still under development? If it is already available, this sentence should be removed and, of course, a clear and direct link to the platform should be provided.</p>
                <p> 
                    <italic>Yes, the platform is under development and will be released according EC in October 2022. After the official launch (and if the Editorial Board of ORE agrees) we can add the running link for the Toolbox.</italic>
