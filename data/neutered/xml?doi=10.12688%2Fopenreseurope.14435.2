                    <title>Background</title>
                    <p>The European space sector is on the rise, introducing a rapidly growing market with a lot of expanding opportunities for innovative space products, applications and services, even in non-space sectors. In this article, we investigate the skill levels of innovation intermediaries that provide support to innovators (i.e., start-ups, scale-ups and SMEs) in the Central-Eastern (CE) and South-Eastern (SE) European space sector. Our objective is to identify: (i) the available competences and (ii) the missing skills (potential areas for improvement) of innovation intermediaries in the EU space sector.</p>

                    <title>Methods</title>
                    <p>Our methodological approach consists of (i) desk research complemented by semi-structured interviews to introduce a baseline framework of innovation intermediaries&#x2019; desired knowledge and skill levels, as well as (ii) an online survey, addressing the case of innovation intermediaries and innovators, respectively. We first solidify the baseline framework with the expert feedback from the semi-structured interviews and then proceed to the analysis of the online survey responses, to capture and discuss the perceived needs of both innovation intermediaries and innovators.</p>

                    <title>Conclusion</title>
                    <p>We conclude that innovation intermediaries in the space sector have the adequate capacity to effectively train and support innovators in improving, primarily, their organisational skills and soft skills. Trainers are also competent at assessing the investment readiness levels of innovators, their pitching skills, and they can provide tailored business support services to innovators. In parallel, space innovators need to receive better training to improve their business modelling skills, better support the management of Intellectual Property, and understand key technologies and market characteristics of the space market.</p>

                <p>The European space sector is on the rise, introducing a rapidly growing market with a lot of expanding opportunities for innovative space products, applications and services, even in non-space sectors. In order to exploit these opportunities, entrepreneurs need substantial business support, to build the knowledge and skills required to benefit from this erupting New Space era effectively. This is even more intense in Central-Eastern (CE) and South-Eastern (SE) Europe, where only 30% of Europe&#x2019;s space support innovation intermediaries are established. In this article, we investigate the knowledge and skill levels of innovation intermediaries that support innovators (i.e., start-ups, scale-ups and SMEs) of the SE and CE European space sector. Our objective is to identify: (i) the available competences and (ii) missing knowledge and skills of innovation intermediaries in the European space sector, investigating their skill levels from two main points of view: (a) the perception they have on their own knowledge and skill levels; and (b) the perception of innovators who have received business support services, with regard to the skill levels of innovation intermediaries. A desk research complemented by 15 semi-structured interviews introduced a baseline framework of innovation intermediaries&#x2019; desired knowledge and skill levels, which was further investigated via two online surveys, for innovation intermediaries and innovators respectively. The analysis of 104 responses collected revealed several interesting insights; we have identified potential knowledge and skill areas where innovation intermediaries in the EU space sector could improve, extending from Intellectual Property management to space market research and business modelling. The results of this analysis provide useful insights for EU policymaking in the field of space innovation support, the development of tailored business support programmes for supporting space entrepreneurship in Europe, as well as for better informing internal business training programmes of large companies and SMEs in the space sector.</p>

Driven by major technological advances, a vibrant entrepreneurial spirit, an increasing appetite for investment as well as renewed policy ambitions, the global space economy has grown to an astounding turnover of $447 billion in 2020, continuing a five-year growth, and is showing no signs of stopping
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1">1</xref>
                </sup>. Meanwhile, space technologies, data and services are finding increasing applications across many industries (e.g., from transport and energy over to agriculture and environment), serving as an enabling element for their digital transformation and providing the building blocks for innovative business models
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2">2</xref>
                </sup>. With that in mind, it may come as no surprise that the global space context is shifting, and it is shifting fast, as more and more new players from the private sector enter the game and innovate, introducing remarkable cost reductions in accessing and using space to create new solutions and capture value from a broadening customer base.
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN1">i</xref>
                </sup>
            </p>
            <p>In this context, a new kind of space race is on, with the private sector competing to capture the unprecedented business opportunities of the New Space era. Despite its world-class space sector and cutting-edge systems in place (such as Copernicus, Galileo and EGNOS)
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-3">3</xref>
                </sup>, the EU appears to be falling behind its global competitors (e.g., US or China) as many success stories (such as SpaceX and Blue Origin) emerge outside of Europe with the support of suitable innovative industrial policies and financial support frames (e.g. first client approach, technology agnostic anchor tenancy) as well as the increased involvement of private investors. Given the vital importance of space for key EU policies and political priorities (from boosting competitiveness to battling climate change and fostering sustainable use of resources)
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-4">4</xref>
                </sup>, lagging behind is not an option. We need to quickly adapt and create an environment conducive to space entrepreneurship, incentivising and supporting EU businesses to start-up and scale in order to seize the opportunities ushered in by the shifting global space context. All while championing the EU&#x2019;s industrial leadership, boosting economic growth, creating jobs and delivering social and environmental benefits to EU citizens.</p>
            <p>Against the backdrop of developing European policies and support schemes for space innovation, several programmes and initiatives have emerged at the EU level, intending to tackle well-known barriers that are preventing start-ups from taking up and/or growing their activities in the EU&#x2019;s space sector (lack of awareness on available opportunities, difficulties in accessing capital, limited business skills, risk-aversity, etc.)
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2">2</xref>
                </sup>. This includes programmes for supporting space innovation through funding instruments such as the EU&#x2019;s Horizon 2020 and the most recent Horizon Europe, the European Investment Bank (EIB) European Fund for Strategic Investments and the European Space Agency (ESA) Technology Research Programme as well as initiatives geared more to start-ups (incubators, accelerators, hackathons, etc.), fostering the use of available EU space systems, data and services in commercial applications (Copernicus Start-Up Programme, E-GNSS Accelerator, Galileo Masters, etc.).</p>
            <p>Space hubs have a vital role to play in helping start-ups to identify and make the most out of suitable opportunities available at the EU level, while at the same time catalysing collaborations and investments that can support their crucial early stages and scale up. Indeed, through local support initiatives, space hubs can raise awareness on the business opportunities offered by space technologies, data and services as well as help space start-ups and scale-ups access the necessary knowledge (technical and/or business skills, technologies, licenses, intellectual property, etc.), networks (business partners, first customers, team members, etc.) and financial solutions (grants, credit, venture capital, etc.) to successfully seize them. At the same time, they are well-positioned to mobilise and bring together stakeholders from space and non-space sectors (e.g., entrepreneurs, researchers, industrial actors, users, investors), with a view to exploring new applications, business ideas and (co-)financing schemes for leveraging space technologies, data and services to deliver demand-driven solutions for non-space sectors (e.g., agriculture, health, ICT), creating new business opportunities and stimulating entrepreneurs to get new ventures off the ground
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-5">5</xref>
                </sup>.</p>
            <p>European policy-makers have already acknowledged the vital role of space hubs in the Space Strategy for Europe, recognising them as a powerful platform for shaping favourable business ecosystems along with enabling framework conditions for space entrepreneurship
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2">2</xref>
                </sup>. In fact, there are already several space hubs that are deploying local initiatives and catalysing space entrepreneurship in the EU. However, these space hubs are not equally distributed across Europe. The majority of them are concentrated in countries that have been historically more involved in the aerospace field (e.g., France, Germany and Italy).</p>
            <p>CE and SE European countries with emerging or existing space capacity, have many vibrant technology ecosystems and industry verticals as well as user communities with great potential for contributing to the increased commercialisation of space (including spinning-in and -out opportunities). For instance, more than 10 unicorns have sprung out of CE European countries (estimated combined value of &#x20ac;30 billion), with a promising roster of start-ups currently on the rise (e.g. UIPath in robotics, Kiwi.com in transport, Prezi in software, Flo in health) and around &#x20ac;700 million invested in CE European start-ups in 2018 alone (e.g. Taxify, Citybee)
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-6">6</xref>
                </sup>. The startup ecosystem in SE Europe is alive and kicking too, with over 5,000 SE European start-ups estimated to have raised more than $50 million by 2016, and a surge of new start-ups, support actors and schemes in 2018
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-7">7</xref>
                </sup>.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the CE and SE Europe are abundant with talent offering a highly skilled and educated tech workforce with great potential for space innovation. Over the last twenty years, the regions of interest have shown positive signs in terms of labour productivity growth, leading to economic growth
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN2">ii</xref>
                </sup>, and therefore converging to the EU average
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-8">8</xref>
                </sup>. The new era and the transformation of many CE and SE European economies require that innovation will be a key component in their new growth models to foster prosperity even further. More importantly, given that the core of the space sector is comprised mostly of the development of cutting-edge technologies and applications, it becomes apparent that the advancement of the space ecosystem in the CE and SE Europe will be positively impacted by an enabling environment for the overall innovation landscape in the region, be it support to local innovation intermediaries or the establishment of new initiatives to support space innovators.</p>
            <p>At the same time, it is also essential to ensure that these innovation intermediaries have all the necessary knowledge, skills, resources and tools in place to effectively organise their local initiatives to support their portfolio of innovators and enable them to engage and drive value from space innovation, bringing the EU at the forefront of the global new space race. Towards this direction, this manuscript, which covers work performed under the EU-funded H2020 InnORBIT project (GA No 101004212)

                </sup>, introduces a thorough investigation of the skill levels and knowledge gaps of such innovation intermediaries that provide support to innovators of the SE and CE European space sector. To the authors&#x2019; knowledge such investigation in the region examined, has not been performed before, and it offers valuable insight not only for the direct market actors involved, but the overall New Space community, with emphasis on European policy makers.</p>
            <p>Hence the research questions (RQs) that arise from the analysis of this rapidly evolving section in the CE and SE Europe are the following: </p>

            </list>
            <p>Towards addressing these questions, the present study offers novel findings to the existing literature that can be organised into 4 main pillars. First, we consider the implications for potential training programmes of an extensive analysis of the current skill levels and knowledge gaps of members of innovation intermediaries. We offer new insights for the market-driven design and development of new initiatives to build the business skills and space knowledge capacity of trainers, coaches and innovation advisors in the CE and SE Europe and beyond. Secondly, and in line with the previous pillar, we also offer practical suggestions for new courses and training content that could be considered in future capacity building initiatives in the area. In parallel, our third pillar of findings deals with the investigation of the current perceptions of innovators in the CE and SE Europe and the analysis of their inherent needs in terms of business support. By doing so, we provide new insights and suggestions on the desired content for the design and development of new business support programmes that will target space innovators in the CE and SE Europe and beyond. Lastly, our study also contributes to design tools for supporting space entrepreneurship in the CE and SE Europe, via analysing the needs and challenges that the local innovation ecosystem faces and by offering potential skill areas (be it business skills or knowledge areas in the domain) for improvement.</p>

            <p id="s2">The role of innovation intermediaries in bridging the knowledge gaps is widely discussed internationally, either via bringing together different actors of the innovation ecosystem (e.g., innovators, investors, funding providers, advisors, policymakers, etc.) or via supporting the diffusion of technology and novel ideas across different industries and technological domains. An intermediary facilitates the knowledge exchange and knowledge transfer to a customer through various channels such as (i) direct knowledge transfer; (ii) exchange of experience; (iii) networking; and (iv) consulting on companies&#x2019; innovation needs and available solutions
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-9">9</xref>
                </sup>. After all, technology transfer is a time-based process involving multiple actors
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-10">10</xref>
                </sup>, while innovation intermediaries and consultants need different capabilities to be able to effectively and successfully support a customer.</p>
            <p>A key component of the existing literature that is currently missing, to the authors&#x2019; knowledge, is a dedicated analysis of the knowledge and skill levels that innovation intermediaries believe they possess when they provide business support services. In parallel, it is also interesting to investigate the intermediaries&#x2019; skills needed by the corresponding counterparts who act as receivers of these skills and services (innovators). Intermediaries&#x2019; knowledge and skill levels in certain business areas exert a key influence on the quality of the services they provide towards innovators.</p>
            <p>Motivated by this,

Based on their results, effective intermediaries should have the adequate capacity to identify the companies&#x2019; core competencies, technological capabilities, and problems in a more abstract yet standardised manner (compared to internal company experts). On top of that, the study of

                </sup> highlight the importance of employees&#x2019; soft skill acquisition. They conclude that innovators and managers need to induce new training methods and curricula in order to enable an effective framework that reinforces soft skills in the company. Given that such training programmes are provided, most of the time, by specialised business trainers and coaches, the aspect of soft skills should be considered as a desired element of an effective innovation intermediary.</p>

Many studies also pinpoint that entrepreneurship is significantly boosted when innovators adopt new digital technologies, upgrade their digital capabilities, and follow a concrete digital strategy, helping them to become innovation leaders (

                </sup>). These findings suggest that digital and organisational skills should constitute a core area of the effective innovation intermediary.</p>
            <p>Within the space domain, clusters, the most common form of innovation intermediary, are an integral aspect that evolves rapidly along the space economy, especially considering that its development is mainly based on dispersed interventions in supporting innovation, rather than a unified national programme
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-18">18</xref>
                </sup>. In a recent thorough international comparison on space cluster development
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-19">19</xref>
                </sup>, the authors have found that &#x201c;skills are &#x2018;sticky&#x2019; and drive the space economy in the long term&#x201d;. Nevertheless, in most if not all cases examined, the space clusters are highly dependent on external entities, such as universities, and even in huge organisations, such as NASA, there is a risk of skills shortage due to an ageing workforce. With all of that in mind, it is difficult to imagine how space clusters can effectively support innovation without being up-skilled or re-skilled, not only to remain competitive within an erupting market, but also to act as drivers and enablers for the innovator ecosystem. Moreover, according to the Space Skills Alliance
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-20">20</xref>
                </sup>, SMEs in the downstream sector, are in need of a more diverse skill set in their workforce, which in most cases cannot be found, mainly due to the lack of resources to invest in up-skilling, but also due to the limited capacity of the available trainers.</p>
            <p>There are sparse findings in the literature regarding skill and knowledge capacity assessment in the space industry. In an extensive systematic literature review in 2014
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-21">21</xref>
                </sup>, have analysed in depth the international technology transfer trends in the space industry. Although they have identified multiple dimensions, they have not investigated the capacity of the involved actors to effectively support their ecosystems, including technology transfer support.</p>
            <p>Focusing more on the actual job market, the Space Skills Alliance has also created a competencies taxonomy
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-22">22</xref>
                </sup>, including extended knowledge and skills aspects. According to their findings, which were based on 812 early career UK space job adverts, a taxonomy of five categories has been created to describe the competencies required from the space industry in the UK. Namely: Traits, Knowledge, Technical skills, Transferable skills, and Qualifications. This taxonomy covers a wide range of necessary knowledge and skills areas, however, its focus is on the overall workforce of the UK space industry, and not on the role of innovation intermediaries as support pillars.</p>
            <p>A recent skills gap assessment in Australia
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-23">23</xref>
                </sup>, revealed quite interesting findings, starting with the fact that there is a clear shift from technical to soft skills and space sector enabling skills (specialised business, finance, regulatory, legal skills), which are even considered critical for the current market. This, along with the shortages identified in almost all of the skills categories in this study, highlights the necessity for up-skilling and knowledge transfer. Going in more depth in the analysis of innovation intermediaries, their activities, strategies, roles and impacts, Vizmar

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-24">24</xref>
                </sup> thoroughly analysed the Scottish New Space Sector, highlighting the need for investment, networking, and capacity-building support, while redefining (potentially) the role of innovation intermediaries for driving innovation in their local ecosystem.</p>
            <p>The existing literature, although not specifically and in detail, addresses the issue of intermediaries&#x2019; skills and knowledge needs in the space industry, offering a variety of desired attributes and skill sets that an effective business trainer/coach should possess. Despite the several factors that could be considered in a framework model for the assessment of the skill perceptions of such trainers, we can mostly identify four key aspects. Namely, these aspects refer to the business skills of intermediaries, their capacity to support innovators at embracing digital transformation and designing a digital strategy, as well as their ability to improve the soft skill of innovators and their networking with relevant innovation actors. This analysis of our framework model for intermediaries&#x2019; skills and knowledge is further upended by also studying the key insights stemming from other relevant EU-funded R&amp;D projects that the authors have been engaged with (see 
                <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), focusing on innovation and business support. It is important to state at this point that the  introduced  framework is  not  aiming to propose a new taxonomy or to get into a detailed analysis of the knowledge and skills assessed, but mainly to offer a better understanding of the current capacity of innovation intermediaries and pathways towards improvements for effectively supporting their ecosystem.</p>

Starting with a desk research based on reports and knowledge gained from previous EU projects, as well as recent literature, so as to develop an initial baseline framework of the various skills that competent innovation intermediaries should possess in order to provide business support services to innovators (Step 1). Subsequently, we deployed a series of semi-structured interviews with experts in the local SE and CE European ecosystems, gathering feedback to fine-tune and validate the baseline framework we developed (Step 2). This exercise enabled us to set a space-related market-driven framework of desired skills and competencies. At the same time, the main elements of this framework were transformed into an online survey to investigate in more detail the views and perceptions from both stakeholder sides, i.e., innovation intermediaries and space innovators (Step 3). The final step of our approach delved into a more detailed analysis concerning the skill-sets of innovation intermediaries needed for leading their innovators to a successful journey into space innovation, as well as the perceived business needs of innovators in the space industry, via analysing our survey results (Step 4). The following sections, provide a more elaborate description of the methodological steps followed.</p>

                <title>3.1 Step1: Desk research</title>
                <p>We began our approach by conducting desk research to develop a baseline framework for our analysis and identify the current state-of-play in the skill levels and needs of innovation intermediaries in providing business support services to innovators. The desk research relied on specific available reports and online sources of other relevant projects (EU H2020/FP7 projects) that InnORBIT partners
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN4">iv</xref>

                    <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). These projects deal with innovation support aspects, helping innovators at gaining access to tailored business support services or bringing their innovations to the market. A particular focus was given to the business and training needs of innovation intermediaries and innovators in cutting-edge industries and verticals. By capitalizing on partners&#x2019; accumulated knowledge in other projects, we are able to outline an initial framework of the required knowledge and skills of innovation intermediaries.</p>

                <title>3.2 Step 2: Semi-structured interviews</title>
                <p>The second step in our approach further calibrates the initial baseline framework and distinguishes between the critical and non-critical skills and knowledge areas of innovation intermediaries. The goal here is to identify any skill areas and dimensions not previously envisaged in our initial framework (Step 1). Therefore, we validate our initial findings, based on the views of experts belonging to our two stakeholder groups (innovation intermediaries and innovators). This exercise reveals which specific skills and skill areas should be included in the questionnaire of the online survey, fuelling the activities of Step 3. Since detailed information is not always available online, we pursued close consultations with various public and private stakeholders from the targeted regions via a series of semi-structured interviews.</p>
                <p>To start the process, an interview guideline that comprised of a summary of the InnORBIT project, an overview of the objectives of the interview and a baseline framework to guide the discussion, was prepared. The baseline framework ensures that the conversations stay focused on the topic and that no important aspects are neglected, but at the same time, it allows for sufficient room for discussion and refinement of the framework.</p>
                <p>By engaging InnORBIT partners&#x00b4; networks we identified highly experienced innovation intermediaries and innovators, which we sought to interview about their perspectives on innovation intermediaries&#x00b4; required skills for delivering business support services, focusing on the space industry dimension and its applications. Two interview questionnaires were developed, facilitating consultations with the groups of innovators (namely: entrepreneurs, start-ups, and scale-ups) and innovation intermediaries, respectively.</p>
                <p>During interview sessions, the baseline framework was presented to experts, with a view to defining the types of skills innovation intermediaries need to possess in order to provide effective business support to entrepreneurs. Depending on the stakeholder group, experts were asked to validate the baseline framework from the point of view of either (i) innovation intermediaries; as providers of support services, or (ii) innovators; as recipients of such services.</p>
                <p>The validation process has been carried out via quantitative and qualitative means. More specifically, interviewees were asked to rate the significance of skills categories and specific skills included in our baseline framework based on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 assigned to &#x201c;not important&#x201d; skills and 5 to &#x201c;absolutely important&#x201d; skills. A skill is considered validated, as long as its average rating and its mode (i.e., the value that appears most frequently in a data set) exceed the value of 3 (average level). This threshold derives naturally from the design of the Likert scale response, under which any value above 3 is perceived positively. At the same time, respondents were requested to identify those skills or skills categories missing from our baseline framework as well as to highlight any changes needed in the definition and classification of skills included.</p>
                <p>In total, we performed 15 interviews (9 with innovation intermediaries and 6 with innovators across the EU) via digital means; interviews&#x2019; insights were collected, synthesized, and analysed further, ultimately leading to the update of the initial baseline framework. The fine-tuned version of our baseline framework built the premises for developing and deploying an online survey under Step 3.</p>

            <sec>
                <title>3.3 Step 3: Online survey</title>
                <p>In the third step, we deploy an online survey to reveal the skill levels of space-related innovation intermediaries based on (i) their own perceptions and (ii) the perspectives of innovators who received these business support skills and services. While this exercise has mostly a geographical focus on the ecosystems of CE and SE Europe, we are also keen to capture the broader perspective of stakeholders from more developed ecosystems (EU level), who either provide business support services to innovators in the region of our focus or have business relationships with innovators in the region. Thus, the broader perspective of our study offers richer insights into the business support landscape and the desired skills of innovation intermediaries that are currently valued by innovators and by market forces in space-related domains.</p>
                <p>We divide each sub-section of the current manuscript based on each skill level category that is investigated in the survey, namely (i) Knowledge in the Space Industry, (ii) Business Assessment Knowledge, (iii) Business Support Skills, (iv) Organisational and Digital Skills, and (v) Soft Skills. To study in-depth each core skill area, we used a set of well-tailored Likert-scale survey questions, addressing specific business sub-element of each core skill area. Specifically, we employed a 5-level scale, with 1 indicating low levels of skills and 5 indicating high levels of skills.</p>
                <p>The selected skill areas and questions of the survey are based on the fine-tuned framework developed under Step 2. The survey was implemented online via a survey tool (i.e., EUSurvey
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN5">v</xref>
                    </sup>) to ensure a broad and effective data collection process. In particular, two separate and anonymous survey questionnaires were developed. The first addresses the perceived skills and needs of innovation intermediaries, namely the perceptions of advisors, trainers, coaches, and mentors belonging to clusters, incubators, accelerators and SME support organisations in space-related and other sectors. The second addresses the views of innovators; we asked them to indicate their experiences and knowledge received from their participation in training with innovation intermediaries, and more specifically, we investigated the skill levels of innovation intermediaries from an innovator&#x2019;s point of view. In essence, we analysed the same factor (namely, innovation intermediaries&#x2019; skills and needs) from two different angles: the service provider side (innovation intermediaries) and the service recipient side (innovators). This approach enabled us to reveal any differences in the perceptions of the two groups under investigation, examine how these perceptions vary, and extract informed implications for the core objectives of this study; (i) to identify the available missing skills of innovation intermediaries, and (ii) to reveal the needs of innovators&#x2019; ecosystems.</p>
                <p>To enhance the outcomes of our research and to reach out to a sufficient number of suitable intermediaries around Europe, relevant experts from the InnORBIT network (within the project and external) were invited to complete the survey &#x2013; these experts include relevant trainers of innovation intermediaries around Europe, such as consultancies, accelerators, incubators, and innovation agencies. On top of that, we disseminated the survey to innovators who are involved in space-related technologies, exploiting mostly the contacts of consortium&#x2019;s clusters and start-up networks. The online survey aimed for at least 100 participants for extracting meaningful insights

                <p>All innovation intermediaries within our sample possessed experience in providing support to start-ups and, in some cases, also to scale-ups and SMEs. Most innovation intermediaries support businesses with activity in technical domains such as space, IT technologies, energy, and transport/mobility. However, in a few cases, innovation intermediaries were described as technology or sector agnostic. Most experts representing innovation intermediaries identified their organisation as an incubator, with 6 out of 9 responses supporting this trend. The rest described their organisation either as a Space Cluster, Business Angels group or Business Agency. The typical service portfolio of innovation intermediaries in our sample includes the provision of incubation and/or acceleration services, mentoring, matchmaking, project management and consultancy in financial, business, and legal issues. Similarly, all interviewed innovators, either have received business support services or are aware of such opportunities and relevant services in their local ecosystems. Our sample of innovators contains mostly start-ups, except for one innovator classified as SME and one as large corporate. Innovators in our sample have developed innovative products and services in high-tech fields such as Artificial Intelligence, Earth Observation, as well as in niche domains, including hardware for space and environmental applications such as LIDAR sensors, lunar vehicles, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers, etc.</p>

                <p>In general, interviewees&#x2019; ratings of specific knowledge and skill areas are comparable to the ratings of knowledge and skills categories. The most notable exception is the need for innovation intermediaries to build knowledge about the National Space Strategy. This knowledge area received an average rating of 2.86 across all experts, 2.75 based on innovation intermediaries&#x2019; and 3.00 based on innovators&#x2019; responses. Therefore, this knowledge area has been removed from the baseline framework.</p>
                <p>The in-depth interviews provided valid grounds to adjust the baseline framework of innovation intermediaries&#x2019; required knowledge and skill areas. In fact, compared to the initial baseline framework, 28 knowledge and skill sub-categories were validated to be important, thus, they remained in the final baseline framework. On the other hand, another 3 additional knowledge and skill sub-categories were highlighted as important and added to the framework, while the description and content of the 4 skill components were adjusted. Those sub-categories were (re-)grouped into the 5 main knowledge and skill areas. The updated baseline framework (

                    </sup>, innovation intermediaries scored above the threshold in 4 out of 5 core skills&#x2019; areas &#x2013; the threshold of our analysis corresponds to the value of three (3), since it signifies the middle skill level. Before delving into more detail, an interesting general remark is that, on average, innovators score the skill levels of innovation intermediaries lower than intermediaries score themselves &#x2013; this is true in 4 out of 5 skill areas (business assessment knowledge, business support skills, organisational and digital skills, and soft skills).</p>
                <p>Respondents (specifically, innovation intermediaries) feel confident in their business support skills and business assessment skills. Besides, they perceive their ability to effectively organise, deliver, and communicate training and coaching modules as very competent (high scoring in the areas of organisational and digital skills). On the contrary, they feel less comfortable about their knowledge of space industry related aspects, such as emerging trends and technologies in the industry as well as business models and legal factors in the space industry, among others.</p>
                <p>In parallel, the aggregate analysis of innovators&#x2019; perspective on the overall competence of innovation intermediaries also offers some interesting insights. In fact, the overall perspective of innovators matches with the perceived knowledge and skill competence of innovation intermediaries per core knowledge and skill area in the following manner: innovators validate that innovation intermediaries possess strong competence in their organizational and soft skills. They also indicate that the innovation intermediaries, they have engaged with, lack some skills and capacity with respect to knowledge of the space industry &#x2013; some evidence also highlight that trainers and coaches could potentially improve their business support and assessment skills. The encouraging factor of our analysis is that the views of innovation intermediaries and innovators coincide, in most cases and knowledge and skill areas, making our analysis a more robust tool to extract meaningful insight for support service for space innovation in the CE and SE Europe.</p>
                <p>Beyond this aggregated perspective, we found varying levels of intermediaries&#x2019; expertise in the sub-categories of each knowledge and skill area. The following sections provide an overview of the key insights gained.</p>

                    </bold> The first factor that we considered in our analysis is the capacity of advisors, trainers, and coaches to know the relevant business and operational aspects of the space industry. As identified in previous literature findings, such knowledge area is extremely important, especially when considering knowledge transfer perspectives

                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-10">10</xref>
                    </sup>. Several aspects of the respondents in this area highlight that they feel very comfortable identifying and assessing potential funding and financing opportunities for the innovators they support, while they also score relatively high in their ability to effectively incentivise entrepreneurs in involving in the space industry. Nevertheless, intermediaries&#x2019; skill levels fall behind in most of the remaining knowledge and skill areas under assessment, making this skill segment a key part that capacity building programmes (such as the one developed under InnORBIT) should aim to address. For instance, intermediaries have low confidence in their skill to (i) identify and asses the existing success cases and sustainable business models in the space industry, (ii) assess how international and national legal, administrative, and economic factors will impact innovators&#x2019; performance, as well as (iii) understand and infer how technological developments in the space industry affect the business prospects of innovators. The figures that follow, present the knowledge and skill levels of innovation intermediaries (

                <p>From innovators&#x2019; point of view, the lack of the proper incentivization mechanisms stands out as the key shortcoming of the intermediaries they have engaged with &#x2013; in particular, the respective knowledge and skill areas record the lowest scores in our analysis. In parallel, innovation intermediaries could be improved in their ability to properly communicate the implications of national and EU-level regulations and technology standards to space entrepreneurs. After all, the overall legal framework is one of the key aspects that new innovators and entrepreneurs should consider prior to starting a new venture or entering a new tech-domain or market, as supported by 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-32">32</xref>. It also seems that both innovators and intermediaries share the same consensus when it comes to relevant financing and funding programmes. Surveyed innovators do believe that advisors who provided business support services had adequate (or even very good) knowledge of the existing funding mechanisms and schemes, especially for those mechanisms that mostly address space entrepreneurs, start-ups and SMEs.</p>

                    </bold> The second area that we investigate in our analysis is the business assessment knowledge that the innovation intermediaries possess when it comes to supporting businesses that are active in space-related domains. In general, based on the views of innovation intermediaries surveyed (
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Figure 10</xref>), the business assessment skills of trainers are relatively perceived as high in almost all specific skill areas and competences of our study. For example, innovation intermediaries feel very confident about their pitching skills, as well as in assessing the teams in terms of skill-sets and management skills. Similarly, respondents indicate that they can effectively identify and assess the value propositions of innovative ventures, supporting them in commercialising their products or services. </p>

                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f11">Figure 11</xref>) with respect to the skills and capacity of innovation intermediaries, we reveal mixed results, which nevertheless, offer some very interesting insight. To start, innovators do agree that one of the strongest abilities of innovation intermediaries is on assessing their pitching skills &#x2013; this is a key component of intermediaries&#x2019; portfolio since proper pitching skills of innovators will help them gain access to potential funding sources. However, we have traced mixed opinions when it comes to the ability of trainers in identifying the core competences of a team behind a venture and in assessing the skill-set of innovators, aspects that have also been highlighted from existing literature

In more detail, despite the fact that innovation intermediaries feel confident in investigating the specificities of innovative teams, supporting their business activities, this opinion is not shared by entrepreneurs themselves. In fact, entrepreneurs believe that innovation intermediaries lack the underlying skills and therefore, intermediaries need to improve the way they engage and assess the quality and the skill-sets of teams. Interestingly, innovators highlight that the assessment of their competitive advantage and value propositions is not adequate enough &#x2013; innovation intermediaries could improve in these areas.

On top of that, advisors/trainers feel confident that they can provide decent guidance to innovators in building successful business models and in guiding them through the various financing opportunities that they could acquire.

                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f16">Figure 16</xref>) also feel that they can understand the needs and preferences of the actors they support, by showing the proper level of empathy when they deliver business support skills. These findings are also validated by the perspective of innovators (
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f17">Figure 17</xref>), who share the same opinions as innovation intermediaries. This consists a very positive and promising finding, considering that soft skills have been highly evaluated and assessed in the literature

                <title>4.3 Limitations</title>
                <p>While the presented methodology for assessing the knowledge and skill needs of innovation ecosystems in the CE and SE European space sector is considered thorough, its results have certain limitations, which warrant discussion to enhance the transparency and validity of our findings. These limitations pertain to the sample size of participating experts and the representativeness of respondents.</p>
                <p>Starting with the sample size, the online survey had limited participation, collecting 104 responses. In terms of the responses from intermediaries, the number (i.e., 58) may be adequate, as there aren't a lot of innovation intermediaries that are actively engaged in the space sector. On the other hand, the responses for innovators (i.e., 46) are quite limited. This is partially justified, as the survey targeted innovators that have received support from the innovation intermediaries that have answered their part of the survey.</p>
                <p>Another significant limitation of this study is that the respondents may not be representative of the EU countries that participated in the online survey. As shown in 
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>, 62% of the respondents originate from three countries, whereas 8 countries are represented with 1\%. This means that the perspectives, needs, and challenges of the identified target groups (innovation intermediaries and innovators) at the EU level may not have been fully captured in the survey. This limitation could impact the generalisability of the findings to the broader population of innovation intermediaries and innovators who are involved in the space sector. However, as all three innovation intermediaries, are geographically located in CE and SE Europe and their maturity in the space sector is quite diverse, the authors believe that the results adequately reflect the overall situation in Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>It is important to keep these limitations in mind when interpreting the survey results and when considering the implications for capacity building and business support programmes for innovation intermediaries and innovators in the space sector.</p>

            <title>5 Conclusion</title>
            <p id="s5">In this section, we present the conclusions of our study concerning the (i) provision of a knowledge and skill assessment framework for space innovation support; (ii) available and missing skills of local innovation intermediaries with respect to effectively supporting space innovation; and (iii) needs of local ecosystems of entrepreneurs, start-ups, and scale-ups in terms of successfully driving value from space innovation.</p>
            <p>First of all, this study brings forth a knowledge and skill assessment framework that covers the most essential knowledge and skill areas that innovation should possess to effectively train and provide business support services to innovators active (or willing to get active) in the space and space-related sectors.</p>
            <p>The framework consists of five main knowledge and skill areas, with 35 sub-categories, as validated by several space and business support experts (see 
                <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). Several high-level stakeholders (i.e., policy-makers, decision-makers, programme owners, etc.) in the European space innovation ecosystem to assess the current situation of the European space innovation ecosystems, as well as to formulate new or revise existing strategies for capacity building and business support programmes that could bring European space innovation closer to the international competition.</p>
            <p>Following, we conclude that innovation intermediaries under investigation have the adequate capacity to effectively train and support innovators in improving primarily their organisational skills and soft skills, which have been identified as core elements for the actors of the space industry, and especially for those that act as innovation intermediaries. Along the same lines, trainers are also competent at assessing the investment readiness levels of innovators, and their pitching skills, as well as they can also provide tailored business support services to innovators.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, a key finding of this study is that space innovators need to receive better training to improve their business modelling skills, support the management of their business Intellectual Property, and understand key technologies of the space market. Based on the latter, space innovators need also to better identify how specific space technologies can be used in other domains and industries, while innovation intermediaries, having a more horizontal knowledge of the potential applications of technological innovations, could act as facilitators in this process. These aspects are quite important in relation to business support and technology transfer, and innovation intermediaries should carefully plan to reais their capacity accordingly. Interestingly, the key role of financing as a core need of space entrepreneurs is validated, since most of the innovators in our study highlighted that they need to receive better support from innovation intermediaries at better identifying funding and financing opportunities that are available.</p>
            <p>To briefly summarise, there are several innovators' needs that have been identified to require better support from innovation intermediaries. These are:</p>

            </list>
            <p>These innovators' needs are quite aligned with the knowledge and skill areas that innovation intermediaries require to put more effort into to effectively support their local ecosystem. These are:</p>

                </list-item>
            </list>
            <p>The results of this study are, of course, not exhaustive and need to be interpreted with caution, while also being complemented by additional studies and surveys, such as the one launched by SME4Space

                </sup>. The assessment of innovation trainers&#x2019; and coaches&#x2019; skill and knowledge levels is a difficult and highly dynamic exercise. There is no inherent homogeneity, nor specific norms in the core competences of business trainers across the CE and SE Europe, since this aspect significantly differentiates form one person to another, and from one innovation intermediary to another. However, our analysis has tried to conceptualise the core elements of innovation intermediaries business skills and attributes when they train innovators, to properly inform the development of future business support and capacity building programmes, with specific focus on space industry and space entrepreneurs.</p>

            <p>This is a much-needed and clearly well-developed contribution to the field of innovation intermediation in the (European) space industry.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The article is using desk analysis, surveys and interview data to build a picture of the existing provision and skills in innovation intermediation across Europe (especially focusing on central and south-eastern Europe). The findings support existing research pointing to significant differences in needs and available support, with the dominance of soft skills, networking, etc, and a lack of support for R&amp;D.&#x00a0;(This has been shown in smaller studies already, like my own work: Vidmar (2019), The Ten Million Euro Question: How Do Innovation Intermediaries Support Smart Specialization? C

            <p> The main challenge of this paper is its reliance on a very narrow set of exclusively EU/Horizon-funded initiatives for the literature review and desk-research data.</p>
            <p> Thus, it neglects recent significant research myself and colleagues have done in innovation intermediation in the space industry (especially in dealing with emerging / non-traditional contexts).&#x00a0;</p>

            <p>This paper provides new empirical evidence and knowledge and skills in the space sector for European countries. I have several suggestions and comments which are listed below.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> 
                <bold>Main points:</bold> 
                <list list-type="order">
                    <list-item>
                        <p>The dependent variables are Likert scaled. Ordinary Least squares (OLS) is not appropriate to analyse the Likert scaled data. Likert scaled variables are usually analysed using the ordered probit or ordered logit model or structural equation modelling (see a standard econometrics textbook, for instance Wooldridge or Greene). Given the sample size, I suggest to use the ordered probit or ordered logit model.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>The quoted literature only partly motivates the empirical model. This paper is about competencies and skills in the space industry, and not about performance.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>The empirical model and the specification are not satisfactory. One type of skill cannot be related to other types. Of course, different types of skills are correlated. I cannot see the control variables. Have you included country dummy variables or firm size?</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>Please outline the contribution of the work to the literature a bit more. Please elaborate on what is already known in the literature and what is the research gap. I also suggest clearly formulating the specific research questions the study focuses on.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>The conclusions are very generic. There are a few implications for stakeholders. More work is needed here.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>The online survey is not presentative. 62 per cent of the respondents are coming from three countries. Are the results different for countries in Eastern Europe? Please provide information on the universe of the respondents (source).</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>There are too many diagrams and tables and very little text. Please look at the study again and revise it.</p>
                    </list-item>
                </list> 
                <bold>Specific comments:</bold>
            </p>
            <p> Abstract: Please make the abstract more interesting for the readers. Please be more specific. &#x201c;&#x2026;.several interesting insights for the future of the European space innovation have been identified&#x2026;&#x201d; This is too generic.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> There are several typos and the language is not always smooth. Example: Countries in the CE and SE Europe, be they with emerging or existing space&#x2026;&#x201d;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Introduction: The paragraph on total factor productivity growth of the CE and SE countries does not fit.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Please provide descriptive statistics of the dependent and independent variables. I can see that the means are reported but not the standard deviation.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Please also elaborate on the sampling design (stratified random sampling) and the treatment of non response.</p>

                <p>We would like to thank the reviewer&#x00a0;for their comments and recommendations&#x00a0;</p>
                <p> that helped us improve our paper. The manuscript has been revised accordingly in an effort to address them. The revised manuscript has been resubmitted.&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> In more detail, as the reviewer's suggestion for the analysis of the Likert scaled data. As the reviewers' comments reached the authors at a point at which the analysis could not be performed with a more appropriate model, the respective analysis has been removed entirely from the manuscript. In addition,&#x00a0;the literature has been updated based also on the input of the 2nd Reviewer. In principle, the literature presented in Section 2 "Related Work", aimed to fuel the generation of the initial baseline framework of skills and knowledge, as well as the timely need for such an assessment. The authors strongly believe that performance is an integral part of our rationale for creating a baseline of knowledge and skills framework, as it supports the fact that knowledge and skills are an essential contribution to the success of innovation intermediaries' support service delivery towards local space innovators. To further enrich the flow of the manuscript,&#x00a0;the specific research questions have been introduced in the Introduction, whereas the Results and Discussion section has been enriched to better outline the contribution of our work to the literature. Finally, a Limitations section has been introduced to the manuscript to address the comment on the sample distribution and country representation.</p>
