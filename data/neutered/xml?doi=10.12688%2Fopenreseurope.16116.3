            <abstract>
                <p>This scoping review (ScR) protocol aims to establish the methodological approach for identifying and mapping the evidence regarding the actual contribution of Other Effective area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs) to spatial conservation targets. Emphasis will be placed on examining the research conducted, including the methodologies applied. OECMs, introduced by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 2010, refer to areas outside of protected areas, such as fisheries restricted areas, archaeological sites, and military areas, that effectively conserve biodiversity in-situ over the long term. OECMs are recognized rather than designated. Many countries currently endeavor to identify, recognize and report OECMs to the CBD for formal acceptance to support the implementation of spatial conservation targets. Studies that assess the contribution of OECMs to spatial conservation targets will be considered. Potential OECMs with primary, secondary or ancillary conservation objectives established by all sectors in the terrestrial, freshwater and marine realm worldwide will be considered. Peer-reviewed and grey literature will be considered without imposing limitations based on publication year, stage, subject area and source type. Both experimental and observational studies in English, French, German, Greek, Italian, and Spanish will be reviewed. The ScR will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology. The protocol will be guided by the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) extension for scoping reviews. The search will encompass bibliographic databases such as Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Grey literature sources will include databases, pre-print archives and organizational websites. The Covidence platform will be utilized for data management and extraction.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>Other Effective area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs) were introduced in 2010 by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) as areas that achieve long-term and effective 
                <italic toggle="yes">in-situ</italic> biodiversity conservation outside of protected areas (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2">CBD, 2010</xref>). Consequently, OECMs represent a novel conservation approach where conservation outcomes are incidental to existing spatial management practices. In other words, OECMs are identified and recognized rather than specifically designated. The definition, guiding principles, common characteristics and criteria for identifying OECMs were agreed upon by CBD parties in 2018 (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-3">CBD, 2018</xref>). According to CBD Decision 14/8 (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-3">CBD, 2018</xref>), key criteria for an area to be identified as an OECM include geographic definition, governance and management, achieving positive and sustained long-term outcomes for biodiversity conservation, including associated ecosystem functions, services and locally relevant values such as cultural, spiritual, and socioeconomic aspects where applicable. Subsequently, additional guidance has been developed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and other global organizations to facilitate the identification, recognition and reporting of OECMs

The latter emphasizes the need to conserve at least 30% of terrestrial and marine areas globally by 2030 through ecologically representative, effectively and equitably managed, and well-connected networks of protected areas and OECMs (

            <p>In recent years there has been increasing research and policy interest in OECMs and numerous countries worldwide have made significant efforts to identify and recognize OECMs to support the implementation of spatially-explicit conservation targets. According to the most recent update of the World Database on Protected Areas (May 2023; 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-16">WDPA, 2023</xref>), 671 OECMs have been recognized by only nine countries worldwide (none in Europe).</p>

                <p>This ScR will encompass both scientific (e.g., articles, book chapters, letters, editorials, books, data papers) and grey literature (e.g., non-published academic research, theses, policy papers, organizational papers and reports, conference abstracts and papers). Scientific literature will be sourced from online databases and grey literature from pre-print archives, organizational websites, and web-based search engines, and suggestions from topic experts. There will be no restrictions on publication year, publication stage (final or in press), subject area, or source type. All document types will be considered, except for evidence synthesis such as systematic, scoping, rapid, and narrative reviews. To align with language competence of the authors, only studies written in English, French, German, Greek, Italian, and Spanish will be included in the ScR.</p>

Defining and aligning the objectives and questions; 2. Developing and aligning the inclusion criteria with the objectives and questions; 3. Describing the planned approach for evidence searching, selection, data extraction and presentation of the evidence; 4. Conducting the evidence search; 5. Selecting the relevant evidence; 6. Extracting the evidence; 7. Analyzing the evidence; 8. Presenting the results; 9. Summarizing the evidence, drawing conclusions and identifying any implications of the findings (

Any sources that do not meet the inclusion criteria will be excluded from the review. Detailed records will be kept of the reasons for excluding specific sources, and this information will be reported in the final ScR paper. In case of any disagreements between the reviewers during any stage of the selection process, a third independent reviewer will be consulted to resolve the conflicts. The results of the search and the document selection process will be reported comprehensively in the final ScR paper.

The data extracted will include specific details related to the participants, concept, context, study methods and key findings relevant to the review objective. To ensure consistency and facilitate collaboration and interaction among reviewers, the data extraction tool will be integrated into the Covidence systematic review management software.

The full set of the raw data that will be collected by this ScR will be available open-access as a supplementary to the final review paper. The data collected will be analyzed by applying descriptive statistics methods. The summarized data will be presented using a combination of graphical and tabular formats, utilizing appropriate software packages and tools (e.g., Miscosoft Excel, Flourish Studio, Datawrapper Plotly etc.). Graphical representations, such as bar charts, line graphs, donut charts, sankey, chord and network diagrams, choropleth maps, word clouds etc., will be used to visually display relevant information and trends identified in the included studies. These visuals can help convey patterns, relationships, and key findings effectively. For example, the number of documents included in the ScR by year of publication will be presented using bar charts. Choropleth maps will be used to present the geographical distribution of the various case studies reviewed. The different types of OECMs will be depicted using word clouds. Sankey diagrams will be constructed to visualize the flow of information between multiple entities (e.g., conservation objective, realm and sector), while network and chord diagrams will be used to depict the connections between the different methodologies applied for the assessment of potential OECMs. In addition to the graphical and tabular presentations, a narrative summary will be included. This summary will provide a coherent and comprehensive description of the findings, explaining how the results align with the review's objective and specific questions. It will offer a synthesis of the key themes, trends, and patterns identified in the included studies.</p>

            <p>Since the goal of assessing the potential of OECMs to achieve "conservation targets" is confined to "spatial conservation" in this review protocol, my first and second concerns do not matter anymore. My third comment was replied by deleting question 5 about good practice and failure. It seems the entire review protocol focused more on the "outcome", but some information on factors that deliver these outcomes can be extracted from Asking Question Five differently. As I think exploring the extent of evidence and mapping it is important for a scoping review, I was wondering if there can be such kind of question.</p>
            <p>Is the study design appropriate for the research question?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Is the rationale for, and objectives of, the study clearly described?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Are sufficient details of the methods provided to allow replication by others?</p>
            <p>Partly</p>
            <p>Are the datasets clearly presented in a useable and accessible format?</p>
            <p>Not applicable</p>

            <p>The authors provided a protocol for a scoping review to assess the actual contribution of Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs) to spatial conservation targets. Although introduced as early as 2010, this novel conservation approach was detailed much later in 2018 and is now gaining increasing attention as the spatial conservation target (the so-called 3030 target) urges new actions for effective conservation management. There is now growing discussion on the possibility of identifying OECMs, as the criteria include multiple aspects from clear governance to various conservation outcomes. Meanwhile, countries such as Canada and Japan, have commenced recognising OECMs and integrating them into the protected area networks. As there is differentiated conservation responsibility among countries due to biodiversity values, socioeconomic conditions, etc., it is necessary to map the contribution of OECMs globally and provide implications for conservation practice, notably in Europe where none OECMs were registered. This proposed protocol is thus helpful to facilitate evidenced-based spatially-explicit conservation practices in future.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The protocol is generally well-written and easy to follow. The overall question about the contribution of OECMs to biodiversity conservation targets is further divided into five dimensions that should be addressed during the scoping review. The review procedure is comprehensive and robust following the agreed methodology. I would like to comment on a few points for further consideration: 
                <list list-type="order">
                    <list-item>
                        <p>As question three focuses on mapping the methodological approaches that assess the potential outcomes of OECMs, I was wondering if the contributions here include not only spatial extension and connectivity but also ecological functions and other relevant values.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>Following the first comment, it may be more comprehensive to address multiple conservation outcomes besides the percentage of area covered in Question Four.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>Question 5 addresses &#x201c;good practices and failures&#x201d;, however, I am not sure whether we are talking about the good or bad methods to assess potential OECMs or about the efficiency of OECM management to deliver conservation outcomes. In addition, defining &#x201c;good&#x201d; or &#x201c;bad&#x201d; according only to the authors of literature seems no practical effect. Addressing antecedents to the success or failures may be more useful.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>I understand that there was no scanning done after the initial presentation of the database (Table 2) based on the search query, but I was wondering if the current Search Strategy, especially the keywords used, can deliver both comprehensive and targeted databases.</p>
                    </list-item>
                </list>
            </p>
            <p>Is the study design appropriate for the research question?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Is the rationale for, and objectives of, the study clearly described?</p>

        <body>
            <p>The article is a protocol for a "global scoping review" addressing the primary question - "What is the current knowledge regarding the contribution of 'Other Effective area-based Conservation Measures to biodiversity targets" with 5 sub-questions - namely:</p>
            <p> "1.&#x00a0;What is the geographical distribution of studies that have assessed potential OECMs and their contribution to biodiversity conservation?"</p>
            <p> "2.&#x00a0;What are the characteristics of the potential OECMs studied in terms of governance type, sector, realm, conservation objectives, and rationale?"</p>
            <p> "3.&#x00a0;What methodologies have been employed to assess the potential of OECMs in contributing to biodiversity conservation?"</p>
            <p> "4.&#x00a0;What is the spatial contribution (percentage of area covered) by potential OECMs?"</p>
            <p> "5.&#x00a0;What are the good practices and failures acknowledged in the literature?"</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> In general, this is a well written protocol which appears to be robust and follows current guidance for Systematic Evidence Synthesis in environmental fields (although I recommend referring to the CEE guidelines (systematic map guidelines are closest to a scoping review)).&#x00a0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Given that this is a Scoping Review I do not understand how the authors intend to achieve objective 5 - "What are the good practices and failures acknowledged in the literature?". There is no critical appraisal of the studies included proposed and therefore it would be difficult to assess (beyond what the individual study authors suggest in each included paper) what is "good practice" (or "bad practice").&#x00a0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> I find the structure of the protocol a bit odd - I would expect to read about the search strategy first and then read about inclusion criteria - but perhaps this is a set template.</p>
            <p> Again there are some subheadings that appear a little redundant which might be due to a template being used - for example "Types of sources" doesn't include the actual databases (but talks about databases) and it is only when you get to the search strategy that this is mentioned. There is considerable scope for streamlining the document. Another example: "Language limitations will be applied during the literature search process to align with language competence of the authors. Consequently, studies published in languages other than English, French, German, Greek, Italian, and Spanish will be excluded from the ScR." Why not: "To align with language competence of the authors only studies written in&#x00a0; English, French, German, Greek, Italian, and Spanish will be included".</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Study/source of evidence selection - if the authors plan to do forward and backward citation chasing then I recommend using&#x00a0;
                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"
                      xlink:href="https://www.eshackathon.org/software/citationchaser.html">citationchaser | Evidence Synthesis Hackathon (eshackathon.org)</ext-link>
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> What is the data extraction tool? Do the authors have an example (even if not complete)? I see that the tool is linked in the data availability - but I would like to see this in the protocol explicitly.&#x00a0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> There are some vague statements in the Data analysis section - for example "The data will be presented using a combination of graphical and tabular formats, utilizing appropriate software packages and tools. Graphical representations, such as charts, graphs, or diagrams, will be used to visually display relevant information and trends identified in the included studies. These visuals can help convey patterns, relationships, and key findings effectively."</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> How will data be presented using what tools and to what aims? I know there needs to be some uncertainty here but the authors can provide more specific details here as at the moment the text is generic and uninformative.&#x00a0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Is the study design appropriate for the research question?</p>
            <p>Partly</p>
            <p>Is the rationale for, and objectives of, the study clearly described?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Are sufficient details of the methods provided to allow replication by others?</p>
            <p>Partly</p>
            <p>Are the datasets clearly presented in a useable and accessible format?</p>
            <p>Not applicable</p>

                <italic>et al. </italic>detail a study protocol for a future Scoping Review to evaluate Other Effective area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs). OECMs represent a potentially large contribution to conserving biodiversity, especially with respect to targets related to spatial coverage and connectivity. OECMs are an intriguing and somewhat non-traditional component to conservation as they tend to be in land-use areas that are not designated for conservation but nonetheless function to conserve various aspects of biodiversity. A scoping review on OECMs is timely, as the reality of the biodiversity crisis necessitates creative and outside-the-box solutions.&#x00a0;The assembled, multi-national and multi-lingual team has put forth a sound protocol that is well aligned with their research objectives and questions.&#x00a0;The proposed review should provide a strong basis for integrating OECMs into ongoing and future conservation strategies, and may serve to facilitate the recognition of OECMS in Europe where none are currently recognized.</p>

            <p> A few additional comments for the authors to consider: 
                <list list-type="order">
                    <list-item>
                        <p>The main text includes German as a search language but the abstract does not. Given the inclusion of an author with a German affiliation, I assume this language should be included in the abstract.&#x00a0;</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>There are no data in this Study Protocol, which is logical given the article type. Still, it may be worth including a brief description of how the data collected in the Scoping Review will be shared, if at all. The "Data analysis and presentation" section mentions the presentation of data in a variety of formats, including "tabular formats" but it is not clear if this would be the raw data or summarized data. A clearer statement on the future data availability would be well aligned with this publication venue.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>The authors may wish to provide more detail in the "Data analysis and presentation" section, in general. Whereas I appreciate that data visualization will be shaped by the data that are collected, the current description is vague to the point that it is not particularly worthwhile (e.g., "Graphical representations, such as charts, graphs, or diagrams, will be used..."). Perhaps the authors could point to some good examples from other published works that represent their intended outputs? This is a very minor issue but would provide more clarity to a future reader.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>I greatly appreciated the "Data Extraction Tool." This provided concrete, detailed information that would make this protocol reproducible.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>In Table 1, it seemed somewhat unnecessary to include the column "Exclusion criteria," as it was entirely empty. Will this be filled during the course of the review? It would seem that an exclusion for the Concept row was included in the text: "...except for evidence synthesis such as systematic, scoping, rapid, and narrative reviews."</p>
                    </list-item>
                </list> 
         </p>
            <p> This will be a large and valuable undertaking and I look forward to seeing the finished product when it is available.</p>
            <p>Is the study design appropriate for the research question?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Is the rationale for, and objectives of, the study clearly described?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Are sufficient details of the methods provided to allow replication by others?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Are the datasets clearly presented in a useable and accessible format?</p>
            <p>Not applicable</p>
            <p>Reviewer Expertise:</p>
            <p>My main area of expertise is in a subfield of conservation science called conservation paleobiology. Through research in this area, and through projects in related areas of study in biological sciences, I have conducted scoping reviews, including using similar methods to those described herein.</p>
            <p>I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.</p>
