            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>This article provides a comprehensive analytical review of the existing literature on identity relations between Turkey and Europe. How Turks and Europeans perceive each other has a direct impact on their attitudes towards and decisions about each other. Therefore, Turkey&#x2019;s status in Europe and Europe&#x2019;s image in Turkey have long been the focus of political as well as academic debates. However, there is an evident lack of scholarly attention on the evolution of mutual representations comparatively in the 
                <italic toggle="yes">long dur&#x00e9;e</italic>. Most scholarly works focus on specific periods of time and investigate either how Turks view Europe or visa-versa without taking into account the mutual interaction between identity repesentations. This analytical review synthesizes the findings of these disparate studies to provide the basis for an evolutionary analysis of mutual identity representations between the two sides over more than a two-hundred-year period.</p>
            <p>The period under focus starts with the French Revolution (1789) triggering intensive identity debates between Ottomans and Europeans and lasts until mid-2010s when bilateral relations between Turkey and the European Union (EU) went into disarray. This long period has been divided into four shorter periods each starting and ending with a remarkable event in world politics or bilateral relations. This periodization facilitates temporal comparison in tracing continuity and change in identity representations.</p>
            <p>The first period (1789&#x2013;1922) commences with the final century of the Ottoman Empire, in which key political developments in both the Ottoman Empire and Europe shaped identity representations of each other on both sides. The second period (1923&#x2013;1945) starts with the establishment of the Turkish Republic ushering in substantial political and socio-cultural changes and ends with the Second World War. This period not only witnessed a rapid transformation of Turkey from empire to nation state, but also constitutes a turbulent age in European history leading up to the Second World War.</p>
            <p>The third period (1946&#x2013;1998) starts with the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, proceeds with the Cold War, and finalizes with the first decade of the post-Cold War era. This period has substantial ramifications for Turkey and Europe as allies during the Cold War and the EU-Turkey relationship in the post-Cold War era. The fourth and the final period (1999&#x2013;2016) covers a comparably shorter time frame which nevertheless had a crucial bearing upon Turkey&#x2019;s EU membership. It starts with the official recognition of Turkey&#x2019;s EU candidacy at the Helsinki European Council Summit (11&#x2013;12 Decmber 1999) and lasts until the Turkey-EU joint refugee deal on 18 March 2016, the final remarkable event before the bilateral relations went into impasse.</p>
            <p>The study examines each period in relation to selected focal issues, namely the issues with respect to which Europe (or Turkey) constitutes its identity by comparing itself with and/or differentiating itself from its significant Other, i.e., Turkey (or Europe). The four focal issues identified are nationalism, civilization, status in international society, and state-citizen relations generating intensive identity discussions in both sides.</p>
            <p>This is the first review of its kind surveying the vast literature on Turkey-Europe identity relations across the four historical periods. The relevant literature on identity relations between Turkey and Europe published in the English and Turkish languages was identified through the search of keywords &#x2018;Turkey&#x2019;, &#x2018;Europe&#x2019;, &#x2018;Ottoman Empire&#x2019;, &#x2018;identity&#x2019;, &#x2018;image&#x2019;, and &#x2018;culture&#x2019; in Koc and Sabanci University databases. In addition, keywords involving the focal issues were used where appropriate. This system ensured that all academic literature involving these keywords appeared in the literature review, and also served as a means to distinguish the literature focusing on identity relations from those focusing on other aspects of Turkey-Europe relations in different time periods. The bibliography provides a comprehensive listing of the 313 works analyzed for the purposes of this review.</p>
            <p>The following sections will present the key findings of the relevant literature on European representations of Turkey and on Turkish representations of Europe in the four historical periods. Then it will analyze the relevant literature on each period with respect to the four focal issues. Overall, the study, through a comprehensive literature review, demonstrates the ways in which mutual identity representations in Turkey and Europe have been contested over a two-hundred-year period.</p>

            <title>The First Period (1789&#x2013;1922)</title>
            <p>The period between 1789 and 1922 covers the last 150 years of the Ottoman Empire and is marked by a constant effort by Ottoman bureaucrats and government to modernize the administration, the economy and the society of the Empire and salvage the Empire from total collapse. The period starts with the French Revolution and ends with the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the founding of the Turkish republic.</p>
            <p>The period starts with the French Revolution, which, despite having little impact in the Ottoman Empire initially, was synchronous with the first extensive reform program in the history of the Empire, namely the New Order (1791&#x2013;1808). The New Order program included the first attempts by Ottomans to adopt European military technologies and asu such it provoked discussions of Westernization and identity. Though the New Order program failed, Ottoman state engaged in successive comprehensive reform initiatives such as the proclamation of the Tanzimat (1839) and the Reform Edict (1856), both of which coincided with two major international crises: Egyptian challenge to Ottoman security in the 1830s which involved Russia and European governments in a game of power and influence, and the Crimean War (1853&#x2013;56) which ended with an alliance of British, French and Ottoman armies against Russia. These crises and synchronous reform initiatives were core drivers which relate directly to the four focal issues of our project.</p>
            <p>After a very brief experiment with constitutional monarchy in 1876, Abdulhamid II dismissed the parliament and Ottoman Empire entered a 30-year absolutist rule which is associated with the rise of pan-Islamism as an ideology in response to the legitimacy crisis of the Ottoman dynasty and government and wider developments in the world. Hamidian era also brought large scale infrastructural modernization, dissemination of public education in the Empire and the rise of a new educated bureaucratic and military elite which eventually brought down Abdulhamid and initiated the Second Constitutional period in 1908 under the banner of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP). The 15 years of CUP government witnessed the two major and catastrophic events which had a decisive impact on the identity issueand sealed the image of the Turk abroad: The Balkan Wars (1912&#x2013;13) which set the stage for the WW I and Armenian Genocide (1915).</p>
            <p>In terms of cultural developments, the period witnessed several major cultural shifts in the Ottoman Empire. Starting with the fashioning of the Ottoman bureaucratic system in the European style and the establishment of the translation bureau, Westernization in urban social and intellectual life spread gradually and geographically from Istanbul to other urban centers. Translations were made from European literature starting from 1850s and Ottoman writers started experimenting with European genres of novel and poetic styles. Consumption patterns and leisure activities as well as architectural style and education imitated European models to varying degrees among the emerging Ottoman middle classes.</p>
            <p>The literature on respective Ottoman and European representations of each other consist mostly of historical scholarship, involving in depth studies of particular events or a genre of texts. The majority of the scholars are students of Middle Eastern history and Ottoman studies and, hence, going by the standards of the field they draw on a wide range of disciplinary approaches from literary criticism to sociology to media studies. The available literature is still overwhelmingly driven by the choice of available material rather than theoretical or methodological concerns. Scholars use archival material (i.e. newspaper articles, archival documents, diplomatic correspondences, letters, popular publications, and visual material such as photographs and cartoons) to identify various representations of the Europe and the Ottoman Empire. As such, the literature overall lacks a dominant or driving methodology; virtually all of the studies rely on close or selective reading of certain textual material with reference to context with the exception of Einar Wigen&#x2019;s work on the concept of Europe in the late Ottoman Empire and republican Turkey (2010), which employs discourse analysis and conceptual study with a careful attention to theories of identity and processes of othering. There are very few systematic studies covering the whole period using extensive samples, such as Cemil Ayd&#x0131;n&#x2019;s comparative study of anti-Westernism, pan-Islamism and Pan-Asianism in the Ottoman Empire and Japan respectively (2007), &#x015e;erif Mardin&#x2019;s analysis of the criticism of over-Westernization in the Ottoman Empire throughout the 19
                <sup>th</sup> century literature (1974), Do&#x011f;an G&#x00fc;rp&#x0131;nar&#x2019;s article on British turcophilism throughout the 19
                <sup>th</sup> century (2012) and Chase Gummer&#x2019;s unpublished dissertation on Turcophilism in German press from 1850s to the WW I (2010). Beyond these, the bulk of the literature deals with a particular genre such as travel writing or photography (

                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-268">&#x015e;irin, 2009</xref>) or a very limited period (

                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-79">&#x00c7;i&#x00e7;ek, 2010</xref>; 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-157">K&#x00f6;ro&#x011f;lu, 2007</xref>).</p>
            <p>The literature on the Ottoman perspectives on Europe and its identity dimension during the nineteenth century mainly focus on the tensions of Ottoman reform process: the desire to become a part of the post-Vienna European order and the formation of national identity which gradually acquires an anti-Westernist tone. Westernization appears as both a desirable phenomenon which involves acquisition of military administrative technology, and also as a social ill which manifests in consumption patterns, material culture and alienation. The literature on European perspective, on the other hand, focus mainly on two things: orientalist representations of the East as exotic and backward at the same time and Eastern question, the problem of the fate of the Ottoman Empire and its multi-confessional subjects in the face of Russian threat and subsequent nationalist uprisings particularly in the Balkans. Particularly the press coverage of successive periods of violence in the Ottoman Empire between the state, Muslim subjects and the non-Muslim minorities have received scholarly attention. The Crimean War (1853&#x2013;56), the Bulgarian uprisings of 1875 and the ensuing Russo-Ottoman War, the massacre of Armenians in 1890s and the Balkan upheavals between 1902 and 1913 seem to be significant turning points that shaped European representation of the Ottoman Empire and &#x201c;the Turk&#x201d;.</p>
            <p>A significant difference between the literature on European representation and the Ottoman ones is the sources used. While the former draws on a wide range of sources from diplomatic letters to daily newspapers and popular literature thus covering both the elite and public perceptions (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-31">Baleva, 2012</xref>;

                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-125">G&#x00fc;rp&#x0131;nar, 2012</xref>), lack of an independent and widespread reading public in the Ottoman Empire for the better part of the 19
                <sup>th</sup> century (until 1908 to be precise) seems to have narrowed the scope of studies to writings of bureaucrats and several elect intellectuals who were, again, active or former bureaucrats (

                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-287">Wigen, 2010</xref>), thus limiting the representative value of the conclusions drawn; only dealing with larger public in the second constitutional period (

                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-157">K&#x00f6;ro&#x011f;lu, 2007</xref>). There is an observable emphasis on British views on the Empire, probably owing to the accessibility of primary sources and preference for English as the language of scholarship (

                <p>It is generally observed in the literature that the image of the Ottoman Empire in Europe shifts from a more positive one to a more negative one during the eighteenth century and the Enlightenment. Both Asl&#x0131; &#x00c7;&#x0131;rakman&#x2019;s (

Drawing on essentialist assumptions based on climate and geography European authors began to perceive an irredeemable difference between the &#x201c;Orient&#x201d; and &#x201c;Europe.&#x201d; Revealing a &#x201c;European self-image as indisputably civilized, progressive, liberal, and rational,&#x201d; this perspective posited the Ottoman Empire as despotic, irrational, backward, fatalistic and stagnant (

This shift in representations is confirmed by Edward Said&#x2019;s monumental work on Orientalism which demonstrated the asymmetric power relations, that is European imperialism behind the particularly nineteenth century European Orientalist discourse which depicted the Orient as its negative &#x201c;other&#x201d; (

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-155">Felix Konrad (2011: 30)</xref> also confirms this perspective and observes that by the eighteenth-century Ottoman Empire was being systematically excluded from conceptions of Europe: Orient and Occident were being imagined as &#x201c;irreconcilable and contrary civilizations&#x201d; under secular criteria. 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-155">Konrad (2011: 31)</xref> notes how Napoleon&#x2019;s invasion of Egypt was justified in France by claiming that they were saving the Egyptians from the &#x201c;yoke&#x201d; of the despotic Ottomans. Herder saw Ottomans as &#x201c;strangers&#x201d; to Europe, whereas Hegel discarded the whole Orient and Islamic East as stagnant immobile and hence relevant only so far as they helped carry the ancient knowledge to Europe (ibid: 32). Thus, Ottoman Empire entered the nineteenth century bearing a dominantly negative image in the eyes of European public, which was further exacerbated by the Greek revolt in 1820s, which appealed to the philhellenism prevalent in Europe and once again reinforced the image of the Turks as &#x201c;barbaric and un-European&#x201d; (ibid: 33). Particularly the literary writings of Lord Byron helped create a highly eroticized image of the Orient which was essentially different from Europe (

Newman, who was a conservative Christian, wrote his history in an effort to influence public opinion against British alliance with Ottoman Empire against Russia in 1853 leading to the Crimean War. As a conservative, Newman was not fond of concepts such as civilization and progress which was championed by the liberals, however his biggest argument against the Turks was that they were uncivilized, barbaric and incapable of progress, which, according to Demiraj, still showed how these concepts were central to British self-perception and the Muslim other. Though Newman highly valued dogma as a Catholic, he had a very low opinion of Islam which he associated with apathy and decay as opposed to Christianity (ibid: 88). He also did not think it proper for a Christian nation to ally itself with Muslims against Christians although Russia belonged to the Eastern Orthodox Church. 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-84">Demiraj (2001: 74&#x2013;75)</xref> observes that while Newman was eclectic in his use of the sources and sometimes neglected the evidence which opposed his argument, still most of the literature he relied on had a dominantly negative view of the Turks as savage, barbaric, cruel, rude and ignorant. Although some travelers saw contradictorily positive qualities in Turks as well, such as hospitality, bravery, sensuality and delicacy, the ultimate verdict was still that they were savage (ibid: 76&#x2013;77). However,

Several French and British writers saw a great ruler and reformer in Mahmud II (ibid: 352) and efforts of David Urquhart, a Russophobe and a Turcophile in the parliament was influential in promoting a positive image of the Turk during the 1830s and 40s (ibid: 355 and

Somewhat contradicting Demiraj&#x2019;s conclusion, G&#x00fc;rp&#x0131;nar observes that Turcophilism was consistently correlated with conservatism and romanticism in Britain through the nineteenth century; liberals supported Turkish cause only so far as it suited their foreign policy objectives.</p>
                <p>However, this positive attitude which peaked during the Crimean War during the 1850s began to erode in 1860s both in France and Britain due to unresolved ethnic conflicts within the Empire and growing foreign debt of the government (

A particularly crucial turning point for the British support for the Ottoman Empire seems to have been the unrest in the Balkans which erupted in 1876 and triggered a major war between Russia and the Ottoman Empire. The uprising and its suppression by the Ottoman army was covered extensively in European and particularly British press. The leader of the British opposition William Gladstone&#x2019;s pamphlet 
                    <italic toggle="yes">Bulgarian Horrors and the Question of the East</italic> was an instant bestseller. Newspapers and the pamphlet described stories of massacres in graphic detail, which created a strongly negative public opinion against the Ottomans and in favor of the Christian Slavs. The &#x201c;horrors&#x201d; came to be known as &#x201c;Turkish atrocities&#x201d;.

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-31">Baleva (2012: 281)</xref> observes that hand drawn illustrations of the massacres consciously invoked famous Western Christian iconography thus making these images accessible to Western public and creating a religious feeling at the same time. Gladstone employed a particularly racist language which described the Turks as &#x201c;the one great anti-human specimens of humanity&#x201d; and the image of the Muslim Turks as the oppressor of the poor Christians prevailed in British public, after which turcophilism was restricted to a few conservatives (

                <p>While, as the literature suggests, the picture of European perceptions of the Ottoman Empire and the Turk is undeniably more complex than simply negative images, it is also true that with the exception of Germany, the image of the Empire was mostly and in the final analysis a negative one which was underscored by racial, religious and ethnic essentialism and the dominant discourse of Orientalism which was a product of the imperial power relations between Europe and the &#x201c;Orient.&#x201d; Moreover, the competing identity narratives regarding the Empire in individual European countries were determined by competing claims about respective national identities. Hence, while Britain and France emphasized civilization and progress as yard sticks in judging the worth of the Turk, German public was looking for a strong rule, order, discipline and dynamism, which reflects on construction of European national identities in the mirror of the Turkish other. Comparisons of the Turk with the Russians, Greeks and minorities within the Ottoman Empire appears to be a significant element in delineation of the representations of the Turk, which was driven by different trends like philhellenism, Russophobia, and philarmenia.</p>
                <p>A major lacuna in the literature seems to be the lack of reflection on the level of analysis (i.e. between public and elite representations, policy makers vs scholars/intellectuals, cultural drivers vs political drivers) and interaction between different levels which makes the identification of the sources and causes of the conflicting narratives regarding the Empire difficult. Another problem with few exceptions is the fragmentary nature of the scholarship which focus mostly on individual moments and impact of particular political events and does not deal with the transformation of representations in the long duree (see

                <p>The eighteenth century marks the beginning of &#x201c;Westernization&#x201d; attempts in the Empire, that is the beginning of Ottoman curiosity regarding the causes of Western military and technological superiority. After the Treaty of Karlowitz (1699) which brought territorial losses to the Ottoman Empire in Europe, the sense of Ottoman superiority was seriously shaken, and Ottoman bureaucrats began to accept that they could learn from Europe. This manifested itself in the gradually increasing number, and spatial variety of ambassadorial missions to European capitals throughout the eighteenth and early nineteenth century until permanent embassies were established in 1835 (see Unat 1968). These missions were the main point of interaction and learning between the Empire and Europe, and the observations and opinions of Ottoman ambassadors are practically the only source on Ottoman perceptions on Europe until Tanzimat era when slowly newspaper printing helped produce a variety of sources (see

                <p>In his book on how Ottoman concept of Europe has changed from the eighteenth century to the Turkish republic and how this concept revealed Ottoman-Turkish representations of self and the European other, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-287">Einar Wigen (2010: 107&#x2013;10)</xref> marks two significant changes in Ottoman representations of Europe. The first significant change happens around the late eighteenth century with the shift of naming from &#x201c;Frengistan,&#x201d; meaning the land of the Franks carrying strong religious connotations, to &#x201c;Avrupa&#x201d; (Europe), a more secular definition of Europe (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-287">Wigen, 2010: 30&#x2013;35</xref>). Concurrent with this shift, in proposing imitation of Europe as the only way to secure the future of the empire, &#x201c;Ottoman reformists split European practices semantically into a 'material' and a 'spiritual' aspect, making it possible to imitate the former while still rejecting the latter&#x201d; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-287">Wigen, 2010: 30</xref>). 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-254">Marinos Sariyannis (2015: 175&#x2013;80)</xref> identifies two attitudes within Ottoman political writing of the time: traditionalists and Westernizers, recognizing, however, that both attitudes had a similar approach to Europe. In bureaucratic writing Europe is associated with order whereas the Ottoman self is associated with stagnancy and ignorance (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-287">Wigen, 2010: 38</xref>). Fatih Ye&#x015f;il also notes how a major Ottoman ambassador in 1890s, Ebubekir Ratib Efendi associates European orderliness and discipline with classical Ottoman ideal of order and circle of justice (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-301">Ye&#x015f;il, 2007</xref>). &#x0130;brahim &#x015e;irin, on the other hand, notes how European cities were associated with sexual practices which were either intriguing or detestable depending on the position of the bureaucratic authors (

                <p>With the G&#x00fc;lhane Edict of 1839, relations of Ottoman Empire with Europe entered a new phase. The edict aimed to reorder the state society relations in the Empire while holding the European states witnesses to its pledge to restore and implement justice and prosperity. The proclamation of Tanzimat, hence, was closely linked to the focal issues of status in international society and state-society relations. Particularly, Sad&#x0131;k R&#x0131;fat Pa&#x015f;a is accorded much attention in the literature (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-19">Ayd&#x0131;n, 2007</xref>;

                    <italic toggle="yes">medeniyet</italic>) for the first time in Ottoman language. R&#x0131;fat Pa&#x015f;a used civilization to mean the new European order which rested on principles and peace and prosperity and associated it, like Ebubekir Ratib Efendi, with the Ottoman ideal of Circle of Justice (

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-353">Mardin (2000: 170&#x2013;80)</xref> also observes how Sad&#x0131;k R&#x0131;fat Pa&#x015f;a preferred Metternich&#x2019;s approach to reform, which emphasized order, efficiency, stability and prosperity, as opposed to Mustafa Re&#x015f;id Pa&#x015f;a who had better relations with British and emphasized abstract liberty. Wigen also notes the work of Mustafa Sami Efendi on Europe which emphasized knowledge and learning as the primary cause of European success (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-287">Wigen, 2010: 51</xref>). 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-268">&#x015e;irin (2009)</xref>, on the other hand, observes how there was still resistance to European influence and intervention among Ottoman higher bureaucracy and how Ottoman diplomats were actually divided into roughly two factions whose political interests determined their perception of Europe. 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-142">Niyazi Karaca (2004)</xref> also demonstrates in his analysis of the memoirs of Mehmet Akif Pa&#x015f;a, the first Ottoman foreign secretary, how Akif Pa&#x015f;a perceived a double standard in application of international law particularly on the part of the British during the infamous Churchill incident in 1836. Although there are very few records of public perceptions of Europe at the time, literature notes that the destructive consequences of Mahmud II&#x2019;s Westernizing reforms helped create an image of him as the &#x201c;infidel sultan&#x201d;.</p>
                <p>The desire of the Ottoman palace to present itself as part of the European civilization was clearly seen in symbolic events as well, such as the visit of Ottoman Sultan Abdulaziz to the Paris World Fair of 1867 and the display of Ottoman culture as part of the Fair (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-356">Zapt&#x00e7;&#x0131;o&#x011f;lu, 2012</xref>).</p>
                <p>The Young Ottomans, a small cadre of intellectuals which emerged from the mid rank bureaucracy in the 1860s, came up with extensive criticism of Tanzimat reforms and Westernizing policies and oppose the arbitrary rule of the Ottoman Sublime Porte. In the writings of intellectuals such as Nam&#x0131;k Kemal and Ziya Pa&#x015f;a, Europeean other was represented as &#x201c;belonging to a greater community with an inclusive identity, one that also the Ottoman Empire can take part in if it adheres to the same practices&#x201d; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-287">Wigen, 2010: 57</xref>). These authors represented civilization not &#x201c;as something inherently European, but as something the Europeans have succeeded in achieving&#x201d; (ibid). Moreover, while the European other was associated with rationality and morality, Ottoman self is associated with irrationality (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-287">Wigen, 2010: 60&#x2013;61</xref>).</p>
                <p>Young Ottomans also came up with the first comprehensive Ottoman liberal ideology and they promote a form of constitutional monarchy, which they learned from European authors such as Rousseau and Voltaire and equated with the ancient Islamic principle of consultation (
                    <italic toggle="yes">me&#x015f;veret</italic>) (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-353">Mardin, 2000</xref>). In Young Ottoman ideology, modern European ideals such as equality and liberty represented the &#x201c;highest Islamic ideals&#x201d; which the Ottomans had deviated from. 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-79">Nazan &#x00c7;i&#x00e7;ek (2010)</xref>, on the other hand, deals with another aspect of Young Ottoman opposition. Situating their reaction to Europe within the context of the Eastern Question and particularly the Cretan insurrection of 1868&#x2013;69, &#x00c7;i&#x00e7;ek demonstrates how Young Ottomans contested European intervention into the domestic affairs of the Empire particularly regarding the affairs of Christian minorities. Hence, while they desired to become part of the European international civilization, they also wanted to protect the integrity of the Ottoman identity as an inclusive project covering minorities. Finally, Wigen also notes alternative views on Europe and civilization, such as Ahmet Cevdet Pa&#x015f;a, a conservative minister of justice and compiler of the first Ottoman civil code 
                    <italic toggle="yes">mecelle</italic> (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-287">Wigen, 2010: 61&#x2013;62</xref>). Cevdet Pa&#x015f;a uses civilization in the plural to indicate and Islamic civilization and rejects European laws and mores as unfitting of the Ottoman way; in his view Islam represents the core of Ottoman identity, the

                <p>A major issue which arose in the late Tanzimat era is the reaction against over-Westernization, that is the criticism of prevalent Western oriented consumption and leisure patterns in the urban centers of the Empire (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-186">Mardin, 1974</xref>; 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-287">Wigen, 2010: 64</xref>). The concept that symbolized this reaction was 
                    <italic toggle="yes">alafranga</italic> (francophile) which was contrasted with 
                    <italic toggle="yes">Alla Turca.</italic> Many late nineteenth century authors have worked with the trope of the &#x201c;fob&#x201d;  or the &#x201c;dandy&#x201d; who did not see the real core of European superiority and simply sufficed with imitating European fashion blindly. 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-186">Mardin (1974)</xref> brilliantly analyzes the dynamics behind this reaction and concludes that the trope of 
                    <italic toggle="yes">alafranga</italic> served the intellectual mobilizers such as the Young Ottomans because it served their concerns regarding the Ottoman identity, and it also resonated with the public because these &#x201c;deviant&#x201d; consumption patterns went against the grain of Ottoman traditional democratic patterns of consumption and leisure activities. As such, while the Ottoman self was linked with the necessary aspects of Westernization, 
                    <italic toggle="yes">alafranga</italic> was associated with the &#x201c;unnecessary adoption of European ways&#x201d; and this dichotomy was reflected on the urban scape of Istanbul whereby certain districts of Istanbul (e.g. Beyo&#x011f;lu) was associated with moral degradation (

                <p>In an interesting study, Avner Wishnitzer, sheds new light on the 
                    <italic toggle="yes">alla turca-alafranga</italic> binary, that of timekeeping (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-289">Wishnitzer, 2015</xref>). Wishnitzer analyzes how a particularly Turkish way of time-keeping (clocks would be reset every day at sunset at variance with seasons), the

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-289">Wishnitzer (2015: 152)</xref> ties his analysis to the concept of progress and the notion that the Ottomans lagged behind, where inadequately implemented or observed temporal practices became metaphors for their standing in the &#x201c;race between nations&#x201d;.</p>
                <p>The Hamidian Era which lasted 32 years between 1876 and 1908 is generally marked with the rise of an anti-Westernist Islamism as an ideology both as part of Abdulhamid&#x2019;s deliberate policies to increase the legitimacy of his rule and as part of a broader trend in the Middle East (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-19">Ayd&#x0131;n, 2007</xref>; 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-86">Deringil, 1991</xref>). Abdulhamid II strove to perfect his image as a Muslim leader, caliph and protector of Muslims and a general leader of the Muslims all over the world (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-86">Deringil, 1991</xref>). In addition to this, he spent conscious and careful effort to present the Ottoman Empire and its people in a better light as part of humanity in the eyes of European public (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-31">Baleva, 2012</xref>; Greene). For instance during the Russo-Ottoman war of 1877&#x2013;78, in response to the European public outcry against &#x201c;Turkish atrocities&#x201d;, Abdulhamid arranged for photos of wounded Muslims to be taken and thus had the &#x201c;Russian atrocities&#x201d; documented (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-31">Baleva, 2012</xref>). In these photos, which were dispatched the European embassies, special care was taken to portray Muslim sufferers individually and humanize them. In a much broader effort, Abdulhamid had an extensive album of photographs prepared with photos of social life from all around the Empire and sent those to various libraries in Europe and America (Greene). These albums particularly aimed at battling the eroticized and exoticized image of the Ottoman Empire prevalent at the time in Western public; they portrayed Muslim subjects as ordinary people (Greene).</p>
                <p>An interesting development during the Hamidian era is the internalization and reproduction of the orientalist discourse within the Empire in a way that reflects on the eastern periphery of the Ottoman realms (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-87">Deringil, 2003</xref>; 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-180">Makdisi, 2002</xref>). Based on his observations on Ottoman government in Mount Lebanon, Makdisi argues that in the second half of the nineteenth century Ottoman government embraced the Western orientalism&#x2019;s &#x201c;underlying logic of time and progress&#x201d; and gradually established a regime &#x201c;in which an advanced imperial center reformed and disciplined backward peripheries of a multi-ethnic and multi-religious empire&#x201d; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-180">Makdisi, 2002: 769</xref>). 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-180">Makdisi (2002: 779)</xref> shows that &#x201c;as part of this project of imperial nationalism that placed the Empire on a par with other &#x2018;civilized&#x2019; states, Ottoman modernization generated its discursive opposite, the pre-modern within the empire, whether in the Danubian principalities, the sands of Arabia, the cities of Syria, or Mount Lebanon&#x201d;. This discursive othering particularly targeted Druzes, Marnoites, Yezidis and other similar groups standing low in the Ottoman ethnic and religious social hierarchy. In a parallel argument, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-87">Deringil (2003: 311)</xref> deals with the &#x201c;civilizing mission&#x201d; mentality of the late Ottoman government by which it &#x201c;came to conceive of its periphery as a colonial setting&#x201d;. In a fashion which could &#x201c;pretty much be summed up as the White Man&#x2019;s Burden wearing a 
                    <italic toggle="yes">fez</italic>&#x201d; an Ottoman bureaucrat described the tribes living to the south of Ottoman Libya as &#x201c;savages and heretics&#x201d; to be saved only &#x201c;by an invitation into the True Faith&#x201d; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-87">Deringil, 2003: 312</xref>). This colonizing governmentality, however, was not simply invented anew in the nineteenth century; Deringil demonstrates how Ottomans dipped &#x201c;into a whole grab bag of concepts, method and tools of statecraft, prejudices, and practices that had been filtered down the ages,&#x201d; invoking the classical Ottoman distinction between nomadism and civil life (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-87">Deringil, 2003: 312, 317</xref>), in a way that was parallel to the one observed by 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-134">Il&#x0131;cak (2011)</xref>. This attitude revealed an Ottoman national identity formation process, which emphasized modernization and civilization and by which the peripheral subjects were gradually less Ottoman (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-180">Makdisi, 2002</xref>). Again, Ottoman orientalist approach to its subjects demonstrates how issues of civilization, state-society relations and nation formation were inextricably linked in the discursive realm.</p>
                <p>explaining the global emergence of an anti-Westernist discourse by the late nineteenth century, Cemil Ayd&#x0131;n compares the emergence and trajectory of anti-Western ideas in Japanese and Ottoman cultures and respective ideologies of pan-Asianism and pan-Islamism (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-19">Ayd&#x0131;n, 2007</xref>). He rejects the essentialist explanations which pit West and the rest against each other and he also objects to reducing anti-Westernizm to a simple reaction to Western colonial and imperialist policies; instead he argues that pan-Islamist visions of world order, just like pan-Asianism, was a reaction to the &#x201c;legitimacy crisis of a single, globalized, international system&#x201d; which had been intellectually justified through Orientalist and racist discourses (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-19">Ayd&#x0131;n, 2007: 4&#x2013;7</xref>). Hamidian era was particularly fruitful regarding rebuttals of Orientalist arguments and the argument that European civilization had been built upon the achievements of Arabs were put forward (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-287">Wigen, 2010: 70</xref>). Particularly, a famous and authoritative Orientalist, Ernest Renan&#x2019;s presentation of the Muslim World and its past as the history of an inferior Semitic race which was incompatible with science and progress triggered a massive reaction from Arabic and Turkish speaking Muslim intellectuals in the Empire (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-19">Ayd&#x0131;n, 2007: 47&#x2013;53</xref>).</p>
                <p>A significant event in the first years of the twentieth century was the Japanese victory over the Russians in 1905, which was a watershed event for the way international order and Orient-Occident relations were imagined (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-19">Ayd&#x0131;n, 2007</xref>). Japanese victory symbolized the potential for success and modernization of an oriental culture and hence inspired confidence in many colonial contexts as well as the Ottoman Empire. Wheras Japan had already been an object of interest among intellectuals and image of the Empire as &#x201c;Japan of the Near East&#x201d; had been used to contest the image of &#x201c;Sick man of Europe&#x201d; (see 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-295">Worringer, 2004</xref>), with the victory, Japan began to symbolize an ideal model of a nation which could compete successfully with Western dominance. Worringer demonstrates how certain features of Japanese society such as reverence for ancestors, bushido ethos and samurai spirit resonated with Ottomans.</p>
                <p>Concurrent with the rise of Islamism, we see the emergence of Turkism as an alternative discourse on national identity. Umut Uzer&#x2019;s comprehensive study on the intellectual history of Turkish nationalism provides three factors that contributed to the emergence of Turkism: the ethnic separatist movements of minorities in the Empire such as Bulgars, Armenians, Arabs and Albanians which gradually made an inclusive Ottoman identity less and less realistic, emergence of turcology and studies of several eminent Turcologists on pre-Ottoman Turkish history and culture which appealed to Ottoman intellectuals and finally the influence of several Russian born Turkic intellectuals such as Yusuf Ak&#x00e7;ura and &#x0130;smail Gasprinski who were awakened to national consciousness in response to Russia&#x2019;s pan-Slavic policies (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-279">Uzer, 2016: 2&#x2013;3, 16&#x2013;17</xref>). Works of turcologists such as Arthur Lumley Davids, Constantin Borzecki, Leon Cahun, Friedric ax M&#x00fc;ller and particularly the recovery of ancient Orhon Turkic inscriptions by Wilhelm Tomsen helped instill national feelings among Turkish literati (

                    <italic toggle="yes">Three Types of Policy,</italic> which categorized the choices available to the Ottoman Empire as Ottomanism, Islamism and Turkism, three selves from which the Ottomans had to choose. Ak&#x00e7;ura believed Turkism was the most realistic choice for the Empire. To this Ziya G&#x00f6;kalp (1776&#x2013;1924), the ideological father of Turkish nationalism, replied with another article which suggested a blend of three paths; the real Turkish nation would be a result of modernization, Islamization and Turkification (

As demonstrated above the concept of civilization had been a key concept in modernization and Westernization debates in the Ottoman Empire throughout the nineteenth century. G&#x00f6;kalp, in addition to civilization, coined the concept of culture (
                    <italic toggle="yes">hars</italic>), inspired from the German concept of 
                    <italic toggle="yes">Kultur</italic>, to define the national community. G&#x00f6;kalp associated civilization with universal, international, technical, economic and progressive categories, and culture with particular, national, religious and immutable categories (

Using Dipesh Chakrabarty&#x2019;s work he demonstrates how G&#x00f6;kalp provincializes Europe through his dual concepts. Topal also agrees that G&#x00f6;kalp&#x2019;s nationalism is a romantic and revivalist nationalism, however he also shows how G&#x00f6;kalp defines these originally European concepts with reference to historical and social dichotomies in Ottoman past such as folk Islam vs elite Islam, folk literature vs court literature, religious fraternities (Sufi brotherhoods) vs religious establishment; former categories associated with dynamism and authenticity, latter categories associated with corruption, decay and imitation (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-355">Topal, 2017</xref>). Hence, in defining Turkishness G&#x00f6;kalp others not only Europe but also the Ottoman past. Topal also argues that G&#x00f6;kalp&#x2019;s conceptualization influenced many conservative thinkers in the twentieth century.</p>

                <p>Overall, in the literature on there is an emphasis on bureaucratic representations of Europe which is understandable considering the lack of source material over which public representations could be analyzed and further elite and public representations could be contrasted. Only &#x015e;erif Mardin deals with the analysis of the reaction against over-Westernization in the intersection of elite and common sensibilities. Like the literature on European representations, there is a considerable number of studies on individual moments and short periods and scant research on diachronic change of Ottoman identity. While

There is an obvious need for further research to test and complement their arguments in a more systematic way with methodological tools of discourse analysis and identity theories.</p>
                <p>One final lacuna in the literature appears to be the lack of research on the diversification of Ottoman representations of Europe vis-a-vis different nations. While it is noted by

                    </bold> Of the four focal issues of our work package civilization seems to be the most relevant issue for the duration of the nineteenth century by virtue of being an umbrella concept which covers the other three issues as well. It is also the most widely running theme in the literature.</p>
                <p>Civilization was a central concept for European identity as well as a key word in legitimizing imperial and colonial projects of European nations (See 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-49">Bowden, 2009</xref>). Accordingly, many cultures under direct and indirect Euroepan rule had to face the concept of civilization and make sense of it in their own way (See 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-232">Pernau 
                        <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Ottoman Empire which was the next-door neighbor of Europe together with Russia was one of the earliest cultures to grapple with the semantics of Western superiority. Already in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century image of the Ottoman Empire was mostly associated with concepts such as barbarism, despotism, stagnation and backwardness, all of which reflected the self-perception of Europe as civilized and progressive (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-77">&#x00c7;&#x0131;rakman, 2001</xref>; 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-155">Konrad, 2011</xref>; 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-299">Yapp, 1992</xref>). In response Ottoman bureaucrats started using the concept as early as 1830s in their increasing diplomatic relations with European nations (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-37">Baykara, 2007</xref>).</p>
                <p>While for Europe the concept of civilization and the dichotomous representation of the Orient as uncivilized remained more or less constant throughout the nineteenth century with the particular qualities associated changing over time, in the Ottoman Empire civilization seems to have varied both synchronically and diachronically (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-37">Baykara, 2007</xref>; 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-287">Wigen, 2010</xref>). Einar Wigen explores in detail various concepts attributed to the word &#x2018;civilization&#x2019; in Ottoman context, some of which are &#x2018;education of Ottoman man and the practice of orderliness&#x2019;, &#x2018;European international system&#x2019;, &#x2018;settled, urban and sedentary life&#x2019;, &#x2018;the level of ideational and material development achieved by Europe&#x2019;, &#x2018;attaining of refinement&#x2019; and &#x2018;bourgeoisie sociability&#x2019;(Wigen, 2015). Hence, while initially civilization is synonymous with international order and thus closely related to the focal issue of status in international society, later in the nineteenth century it is additionally associated with broader social practices and patterns all of which bear significantly upon the issue of proper citizenship and state-society relations. Again, as Wigen notes while initially civilization was a concept in the singular for Ottomans, by the last few decades of the nineteenth century alternative civilizations could be imagined and the term Islamic civilization had been coined (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-287">Wigen, 2010</xref>). This was parallel with the rise of anti-Westernism and emergence of alternative international orders such as pan-Islamism and pan-Asianism (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-19">Ayd&#x0131;n, 2007</xref>).</p>
                <p>The concept of civility was also significant in that it represented an overlap of Ottoman self-representations inherited from classical doctrines and internalization of Western orientalist representations. As highlighted by 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-134">Il&#x0131;cak (2011)</xref>,

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-87">Deringil (2003)</xref>, Ottoman self-representation as civil as opposed to nomadic and savage followed a traceable pattern during the nineteenth century by which Ottoman government imagined its own center-periphery relations.</p>
                <p>By the second constitutional period civilization was an issue whose definition had become a distinguishing factor between the competing Ottoman ideologies of Islamism, Turkism and Westernism. It was particularly a defining concept in Ziya G&#x00f6;kalp&#x2019;s nationalism and his distinction between civilization and culture was the most successful in defining limits and boundaries of emerging Turkish nationhood (

                    </bold>. Early in the nineteenth century, it was of paramount importance for the Ottoman Empire to be a part of the European international order. After the Greek Independence which was secured by an alliance of the British, the French and the Russians and facing a domestic challenge from Egypt, the Ottoman government increasingly turned to European states and strove to improve its diplomatic relations to benefit from the advantages of international law. As noted above, the first usage of the concept of civilization in Ottoman language was to denote the post-Napoleonic European order based on balance and peace to which a part of Ottoman bureaucracy aspired (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-19">Ayd&#x0131;n, 2007</xref>; 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-353">Mardin, 2000</xref>). Hence, the Tanzimat Edict (1839) invoked European nations as witnesses to Ottoman domestic reform and the Reform Edict of 1856 coincided with the Paris Conference which would end the Crimean War in which Ottomans allied with the British and the French against the Russians. However, with the Cretan insurrection in 1866 and Bulgarian revolt in the 1876, Ottoman status in international order was again compromised due to treatment of minorities which is closely linked to the focal issue of state-society relations. Status of Ottoman Christian subjects was a constant issue in Europe (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-119">Gummer, 2010</xref>; 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-125">G&#x00fc;rp&#x0131;nar, 2012</xref>) and the constant intervention of European states and Russia in favor of Ottoman subjects impaired Ottoman sovereignty and her trust in the international system which reflected on the representation of Europe (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-79">&#x00c7;i&#x00e7;ek, 2010</xref>).</p>
                <p>In the final decades of the nineteenth century alternative projects of international order emerged, such as pan-Islamism and pan-Asianism as a response to the failure of the project of a single global order lead by Europe and its justification mechanisms which drew heavily on racial explanations (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-19">Ayd&#x0131;n, 2007</xref>). These alternative projects also came with a serious anti-Westernist discourse. Pan-Islamism and the cause of the caliphate was the Ottoman manifestation of this trend.</p>
                <p>While pan-Turkism was not as anti-Westernist as pan-Islamism, the adoption of German 
                    <italic toggle="yes">Kultur</italic> argument against civilization during the emergence of Turkish nationalism particularly in the writings of Ziya G&#x00f6;kalp, signifies another significant shift in the way Ottoman Empire imagined and represented the international order.</p>

                    </bold>. The emergence of nationalism has attracted a lot of attention in modern Ottoman studies with a particular focus on the post-1908 period. During the Tanzimat era, the main solution to the Ottoman problem of citizenship was the idea of Ottomanism, an inclusive identity which proposed the allegiance to Ottoman throne as a unifying factor for all Ottoman subjects (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-353">Mardin, 2000</xref>; 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-279">Uzer, 2016</xref>). As argued by 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-279">Umut Uzer (2016)</xref>, fate of Ottomanism was sealed with successive nationalist revolts in the Empire and inspired by the research on ancient Turkic history several intellectuals began to envision a less inclusive Turkish nationalism. While competing with alternative identity projects like Islamism, Turkism still shared a lot of common ground with these alternative projects such as definition of the nation by distinguishing it from the international civilization which was associated with Western civilization (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-355">Topal, 2017</xref>).</p>
                <p>Literature emphasizes that Turkism in the late Ottoman Empire was not based on racial premises; it was rather a linguistic or cultural nationalism with an emphasis on Islam as an essential component of Turkishness (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-350">Heyd, 1950</xref>;

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-355">Topal (2017)</xref> also argues that Turkists like Ziya G&#x00f6;kalp actually promoted a competing definition of Islam which emphasized spirituality, experience and a public morality instead of ritual practice, legality and individual morality. The relationship of Turkists with the ruling Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) has also been discussed: 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-279">Uzer (2016: 30&#x2013;31)</xref> concludes that while the CUP at times used Turkist sentiments pragmatically and tried to control the Turkist organizations, Turkists maintained a careful distance to the government and this mutual distance persisted into the early republic. Finally, the work of

                    </bold>. The relationship of Ottoman state with its non-Muslim subjects was a major concern for European states throughout the nineteenth century. Starting with the Greek revolt and their subsequent independence, European powers frequently intervened in the domestic affairs of the Ottoman Empire in order to secure the rights of its non-Muslim subjects against the perceived &#x201c;despotism&#x201d; of the Ottoman government. Russia invoked its status as the protector of orthodox Christians to incite agitation in the Balkans and create public opinion against the Ottoman Empire in Europe. Two major reform projects, the G&#x00fc;lhane Edict of 1839 and Reform Edict of 1856 were both attempts by the Empire to reorganize the state society relations, the former adjusting taxation and the newly introduced conscription and the latter by introducing legal equality to all Ottoman subjects regardless of religious denomination. However, the Ottoman government was not able to solve the status and material inequalities between the subjects in practice and with the growing unrest in the Balkans from 1876 onwards, the Empire&#x2019;s image gradually deteriorated and began to be associated with &#x201c;atrocities&#x201d; (

                <p>As noted, the relations between the modernizing Ottoman government and its subjects &#x2013;particularly non-Muslim and heterodox groups- in the periphery took on a colonial twist. Ottoman government took it upon itself to civilize, educate and modernize these groups in an effort to reach an inclusive identity under the banner of Ottomanism and loyalty to the throne (

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-353">Mardin, 2000</xref>). As noted above this situation created a vicious circle of minorities problems for the Ottoman government whereby separatist groups within the ethnic and religious minorities would incite unrest citing Ottoman maladministration hoping for foreign intervention, after which the Ottoman military would suppress the revolts (generally in a bloody fashion) thus fulfilling the prophecy (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-119">Gummer, 2010</xref>). Successive breaks of different minority groups from the Empire meant the failure of Ottomanism, and gradually led to narrower definitions of national identity. Particularly after the Balkan Wars and massive Muslim population flow into the Empire, the national identity was associated more and more with Muslimhood and Turkish ethnicity as evidenced by Ziya G&#x00f6;kalp&#x2019;s project, in which non-Muslims did not have a place (

            <title>The second period (1923&#x2013;1945)</title>
            <p>The second period (1923&#x2013;1945) under scrutiny, namely the Republican period, starts from the proclamation of the Turkish Republic and lasts until the end of the Second World War. The Republican period is marked by key political and cultural developments that completely changed the governing mechanism of the country and triggered a remarkable societal transformation. Crucial political events during this period include the signature of the Treaty of Lausanne (24 July 1923) confirming the independence and equal sovereignty of the new Turkish state, the compulsory population exchange between Greece and Turkey (1923&#x2013;1924), the abolition of the Caliphate (3 March 1924), the decision of the League of Nations to confer the sovereignty of Mosul to Iraq (5 June 1926), The law conferring women in Turkey the right to vote and get elected in national elections (5 December 1934), The Montreux International Straits Convention (20 July 1936) authorizing Turkey&#x2019;s sovereignty over the Istanbul and Gallipoli staits, the accession of the Sanjak of Alexandretta (Hatay) to Turkey (30 June 1939) and the &#x2018;Capital levy&#x2019; issued to non-Muslim citizens of Turkey during the Second World War (11 November 1941).</p>
            <p>Notable cultural developments contributing to the transformation of the Turkish society include the adoption of the Hat reform (25 November 1925), the introduction of the Latin alphabet (1 November 1928), the victory of Keriman Halis winning the title of Miss World in Belgium (1932), the immigration of Nazi-persecuted Jewish German and Austrian intellectuals to Turkey triggering the University reform in the Republic (1933), the 12th International Woman Suffrage Alliance Congress held in Istanbul (18&#x2013;25 April 1935) and the World Olympics held in Berlin (1&#x2013;16 August 1936) where Turkey won its first ever medals.</p>
            <p>Moreover, there were a number of official and unoffical visits by notable European figures to Turkey and Turkish visits to Europe including the visit by Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos resulting in the signature of a treaty of friendship (25 October 1930), the visit of Richard N. Coudenhove-Kalergi, an Austrian-Japanese pioneer of European integration (early 1930s), the King of England, Edward VIII&#x2019;s visit to Istanbul (4&#x2013;6 September 1936), the participation of Turkish Prime Minister &#x0130;smet &#x0130;n&#x00f6;n&#x00fc; to the Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in London (9&#x2013;21 May 1937) and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill&#x2019;s meeting with President &#x0130;n&#x00f6;n&#x00fc; in Adana during the Second World War (30 January 1943).</p>
            <p>In comparison to other three periods, the identity representations of Turkey and Europe during the Republican era remain rather under-studied. Even though there are numerous sources touching upon the Republican period, there is an evident lack of in-depth analysis on the Republican era. Comprehensive scholarly volumes covering a long period of Turkish-European relations rather neglect this period (

The existing literature on the Second World War is either composed of sources with a general perspective on Turkish foreign policy (

Moreover, most works dwelling on the Republican period rather examine Turkey&#x2019;s top-down Westernization process without offering a detailed analysis on how Europe was perceived in the Republican Turkey and how the Republican transformation was received by European society (

            <p>There are only a handful of sources that specifically focus on the representation of Turks and/or Europeans during the Republican era, and among them, two recent studies stand out, namely &#x201c;Turkey and the idea of a European Union during the inter-war years, 1923&#x2013;39&#x201d; by

                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-313">Zarakol (2010)</xref>. The work of Barlas and G&#x00fc;ven&#x00e7; proves to be an original attempt to scrutinize the European perceptions of Turkey during the Republican era through a detailed discussion of the endeavors for the establishment of an early version of European Union

                </sup> and how Turkey&#x2019;s inclusion in such a Union was contemplated by Europeans. Zarakol, on the other hand, focuses on the Turkish side of the story and succinctly explains how the Republican elite perceived Europe or West and made efforts to remedy the sense of defeatedness and build self-confidence through Westernization. However, inspite of these prominent scholarly works, there is still a lack of a comprehensive analysis focusing on both the Turkish depictions of Europeans and European perceptions on Turks during the period in a comparative fashion. Zarakol shares useful insights over the Turkish image in Europe giving examples from the British press, but the bulk of the work focuses on how the Republican Turks approached the West.</p>

However, as previously highlighted, except for a handful of sources, the bulk of the literature does not necesarily focus on the identity discussions between Turkey and Europe on a systematic fashion, but briefly touches upon the effects of the Republican transformation in the creation of a new Turkish identity and its reflections in Europe.</p>
            <p>In terms of methodology, discourse analysis focusing on political speeches with a particular focus on the speeches of Atat&#x00fc;rk and other Republican elite such as Tevfik R&#x00fc;&#x015f;t&#x00fc; Aras, Mahmut Esat Bozkurt and Hamdullah Suphi Tanr&#x0131;&#x00f6;ver, as well as the speeches and comments of European political figures including Aristide Briand and Edouard Herriot, stands as the dominant approach (

Historical method with reference to archival research, including the archives on the minutes of the League of Nations sessions, and British, French, Italian and Turkish diplomatic archives, remains another popular method used in the literature (

                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-313">Zarakol, 2010</xref>) and literary texts such as poems and novels (

                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-313">Zarakol, 2010</xref>) proves to be another notable methodological preference. Finally, studies examining the identity discussions of Republican Turkey reflected into fine arts such as operas (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-277">Turan &amp; Komsuo&#x011f;lu, 2007</xref>) and paintings (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-39">Bibina, 2000</xref>) bring metohodological novelty to the scholarly literature, despite the fact that there is no such study scrutinizing the image of Europe in Turkish fine arts.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, there is a strong tendency in the literature to examine political discourses at a rhetorical level without necessarily working on actual speeches (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-55">Brewin, 2000</xref>; 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-127">Helvac&#x0131;o&#x011f;lu, 1996</xref>;

                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-235">Polat, 2006</xref>). Therefore, most of the studies with a claim to scrutinize political discourses are not necesarilly based on empirical research. A similar trend is also visible in other genres including history (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-167">Kuran-Bur&#x00e7;o&#x011f;lu, 2003</xref>;

                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-148">Keyder, 1993</xref>) where assertions are not actually substantiated with empirical findings. Besides, the scholarly works that benefit from speeches and other texts do not necessarily provide an analytical discourse analysis thoroughly examining the meanings of political/cultural expressions in different political/cultural contexts, but rather pragmatically employ the speeches of certain political figures as a confirmation tool for authors&#x2019; arguments. Overall, there is an evident lack of a study that offers a (critical) discourse analysis by comprehensively examining European and Turkish political speeches and other texts to come up with a comparative perspective on identity depictions between Turks and Europeans during the Republican period.</p>
            <sec>
                <title>European representations of Turkey during the Republican era</title>
                <p>This section scrutinizes how (or whether) the establishment of the Turkish Republic altered the Turkish image in Europe. There are two main trends in the literature. Accordingly, the bulk of the scholarly works dealing with the Republican era argue that the pro-Western reforms in Turkey were praised by some circles in the West, but the historical image of Turks in the eyes of Europeans did not necessarily change. In response, a minority of scholars focus on a number of European figures who believe in Turkey&#x2019;s capability to become &#x2018;like&#x2019; European.</p>
                <p>According to 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-167">Kuran-Bur&#x00e7;o&#x011f;lu (2003: 33&#x2013;34)</xref>, Atat&#x00fc;rk aimed to dismantle the historical image of Turks in Europe by adopting the principles of secularism and non-intervention. Through Secularism, Atat&#x00fc;rk believed Turkey would negate its image as the religious other of Europe. In other words, &#x201c;Islam which had always been a significant issue that had made the Turks seem different in the eyes of the Europeans would cease to be an important issue&#x201d; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-167">Kuran-Bur&#x00e7;o&#x011f;lu, 2003: 34</xref>). Second, Atat&#x00fc;rk declared to the Western world that new Turkey would not be a revisionist power in order to address the long-standing European fear of &#x201c;the expansionist Turk&#x201d; (Ibid). these reforms, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-167">Kuran-Bur&#x00e7;o&#x011f;lu (2003: 36)</xref> argues, were impressive yet insufficient to have a remarkable impact upon European perceptions, since the historical negative image of Turks proves to be &#x201c;deeply rooted&#x201d; in European society.</p>
                <p>Another pro-Western reform, the adoption of latin alphabet is evaluated by 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-292">Wood (1929)</xref> as a positive step to help bridge the cultural divide between Turkey and the West, but Wood too admits that it does not necessarily erase Turkey&#x2019;s &#x2018;outgroup&#x2019; status in the eyes of the West. 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-292">Wood (1929: 195)</xref> claims that Turkey has always been considered an &#x2018;out group&#x2019; by the West due to the differences in &#x2018;government, religion, the organization of the family, language, dress&#x2019;. Hence, breaking the language barrier by latinizing the alphabet only helped to build an &#x2018;understanding and good will between the Western nations and the Turkish &#x201c;out&#x201d; group&#x2019; (Ibid). 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-241">Robins (1996: 65)</xref> reaches a similar conclusion as he admits that Turks were and are still considered by Europeans as &#x2018;peculiar people&#x2019;, &#x2018;not authentically of the West&#x2019;, &#x2018;an outsider, an interloper in the European community&#x2019;, despite the Republican attempts for Westernization.</p>
                <p>The scholarly literature mainly argues that the Republican reforms failed to make a decisive impact in Europe, because Europeans were either unconvinced or unwilling to admit that such a top-down transformation would trigger an identity change in Turkish society. 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-313">Zarakol (2010: 112)</xref> claims that Europeans certainly did not expect a Europe-friendly state would emerge out of a national movement which had fought against Europe a couple of years earlier. Western powers secured a fear that the new Republic would either usurp the powers of the Caliphate to mobilize the Asian Muslims or support Communism (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-313">Zarakol, 2010: 132</xref>). Besides, Western governments, according to 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-71">Criss (2008: 83)</xref>, were rather suspicious of the Westernization process in Turkey since they did not believe the regime would last long enough to maintain the reforms. Most European ambassadors refused to transfer their residence from Istanbul to Ankara, the capital of new Turkey until 1931 (Ibid). European press was mostly sceptic of the success of a top-down reform process. There were two tendencies in the European press towards the Republican reforms: the reforms were either stigmatized as the impositions of an authoritarian leader or they were regarded as a positive step doomed to fail (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-313">Zarakol, 2010: 139</xref>). In the 1930s, the British press started to appreciate Turkish modernization, but still did not locate Turkey within Europe. 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-313">Zarakol (2010: 139)</xref> gives the example of

Loraine was frustrated to have to leave the exotic Ottoman city of Istanbul for the Republican Ankara, a &#x2018;Godforsaken hole&#x2019; having &#x2018;the atmosphere of an internment camp&#x2019; (Ibid).</p>
                <p>Moreover, the approaches of major European governments regarding Turkey&#x2019;s inclusion to an early version of European Union were rather pragmatic than identity-based (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-34">Barlas &amp; G&#x00fc;ven&#x00e7;, 2009: 431</xref>). French Prime Minister Aristide Briand&#x2019;s proposal for European Union in the 1930s excluded Turkey for it was geographically located outside the European continent. Turkish statesmen protested Briand accusing him of drawing arbitrary boundaries of Europe, and claimed that &#x201c;Turkey was geographically in Europe, since it was bounded by two European seas: the Black Sea and the Mediterranean&#x201d; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-34">Barlas &amp; G&#x00fc;ven&#x00e7;, 2009: 432</xref>). Briand&#x2019;s approach to Turkey did not actually represent the European views, since Germany, Italy and Greece advised the inclusion of Turkey to the project. However, theythey strategically aimed to either include Turkey in their political and military bloc or prevent it from sliding to orbit of their rivals (

                <p>Not only European politicians, bureaucrats and press, but also European public and artists were either unaware or unwilling to consider the Republican transformation as a pro-European identity change in Turkey. For instance, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-55">Brewin (2000)</xref> highlights the lack of interest in European society towards the emerging Republican Turkey.

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-55">Brewin, 2000: 103</xref>). This indifference was especially reflected into arts and literature for European artists chose to remain loyal to the long-standing image of the Turk. For example, discussing the representations of Turks in Norway through novels, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-270">Tahir and T&#x00fc;rker (2000: 74)</xref> claim that Norwegian view of Turks did not necessarily change when the Turkish Republic replaced the Ottoman Empire, because &#x201c;even though the regime and borders have changed people are the same: they are Turks&#x201d;.

After the Communist takeover, Romanian history books approached the Republican era from a rather Marxist lense depicting the Republican elite as an emerging national bourgeoisie aiming to modernise the country after its liberation from a military-feudal regime and foreign invaders (

                <p>There are only a couple of scholarly works emphasizing Turkey&#x2019;s capability to become European with reference to the views of notable European figures. The most notable person highlighted in the scholarly literature is Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, an Austrian-Japanese politician and the pioneer of the idea of Pan-Europe, who once considered Turkey as a military threat to Europe in 1923, decided to include Turkey within political Europe after his visit to Turkey in 1934 (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-34">Barlas &amp; G&#x00fc;ven&#x00e7;, 2009: 438</xref>). He depicted the Turkey of Atat&#x00fc;rk in the 1930s as &#x201c;a compensation for what had been lost to Europe in the north and in the east as a result of the First World War&#x201d; (Ibid). According to

                <title>Turkish representations of Europe during the Republican era</title>
                <p>The literature about Turkish perceptions on Europe during the Republican period is relatively understudied. Only several sources attempt to answer how the Republican Turks viewed Europe. Nevertheless, the extant literature still manages to offer four different explanations to the representations of Europe/West

                    </sup> in Republican Turkey.</p>
                <p>The most popular scholarly answer is the ambivalence in the Republican understanding of Europe or the West, viewing it both as a threat and a model. For instance, according to 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-127">Helvac&#x0131;o&#x011f;lu (1996: 516)</xref>, the Republican regime perceived Europe both as a foreign invader and collaborator with the Ottomans, and as a model for Turkish Westernization. This duality laid the foundations of today&#x2019;s perceptions towards Europe as &#x201c;both the enemy and the object of desire&#x201d; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-127">Helvac&#x0131;o&#x011f;lu, 1996: 518</xref>). Studying the evolution of Occidentalism (representation of West in the non-Western minds) in Turkey, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1">Ah&#x0131;ska (2003: 367)</xref> traces a similar ambivalence in the Kemalist reading of Westernization. Accordingly, the Republican regime acknowledged Western civilization as superior to the Ottoman heritage, but also considered it a threat due to its morality, class struggles and imperialism (Ibid). Nevetheless, the Republican elite chose to adopt Westernization for it was viewed as the source of progress, despite the threats it poses to the Turkish society. This argument resonates with the notion of &#x201c;Westernization in spite of the West&#x201d; which was even influential in the Republican architecture. 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-51">Bozdo&#x011f;an (1998: 139)</xref> points to a paradox of the Republican elite who embraced European architecture as a token of Turkish modernization but introduced this new Europe-inspired architecture with an anti-imperialist and anti-orientalist discourse. 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-51">Bozdo&#x011f;an (1998: 140)</xref> explains that cubical and prismatic forms used by the Republican architects not only represented Turkey&#x2019;s withdrawal from &#x201c;&#x015e;arkl&#x0131;l&#x0131;k&#x201d; (Easternism), but also emphasized its total independence. 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-159">K&#x00f6;sebalaban (2007: 88)</xref> calls this dual positioning as &#x2018;defensive modernization&#x2019; which requires the adoption of Western civilization and abandonment of local traditions and moral codes in order to stay strong against the West. Referring to the works of prominent writers of the period such as Ahmet A&#x011f;ao&#x011f;lu, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-159">K&#x00f6;sebalaban (2007: 89)</xref> depicts Turkish modernization as &#x201c;Westernization for the sake of resisting the West&#x201d; with an eagerness to learn from &#x201c;the enemy&#x201d; rather than integrate. Accordingly, Europe was perceived as the center of the civilization, which Kemalists strived to become a part of; though it was also considered a threat to Turkish independence and national integrity (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-159">K&#x00f6;sebalaban, 2007: 90</xref>). Similarly, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-42">Bilgin (2009)</xref> indicates that Turkish adoption of Westernism/Europeanism was largely in reaction to &#x2018;Early republican insecurities vis-&#x00e0;-vis European/international society&#x2019;. The West/Europe used a civilizational discourse to leave Turkey out from the West, which according to Europeans proved that Turks did not deserve to survive as an independent nation (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-42">Bilgin, 2009: 117</xref>). Hence, Turkey embaced Westernization to stand against Western imperialism. According to 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-313">Zarakol (2010: 144)</xref>, the Republican elite was aware of the costs of adopting Western values, but persistent on entering the &#x2018;modern civilization&#x2019;, they were willing to pay the price for it.</p>
                <p>Second, the Republican elite believed the West had certain Orientalist prejudices against Turkey mainly &#x2018;because of the difference in costume&#x2019; which needed to be addressed (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-313">Zarakol, 2010: 147</xref>). This is why cosmetic reforms such as the replacement of Fez with Western-style hat were introduced to erase the &#x2018;Orientalist&#x2019; notions in the West (Ibid).</p>
                <p>Third, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-101">Ergin (2010)</xref> points to the dividedness of the Turkish public towards Europe/West during the Republican period. She analyzes two different characters from the Republican period, a Kemalist and an Islamist from Orhan Pamuk&#x2019;s novel, 
                    <italic toggle="yes">Snow</italic>. The characters reflect a profound split within the Turkish society both towards the new Republic and Europe/West. The Kemalist character, also called 
                    <italic toggle="yes">Jacoben</italic> since the French Revolution was considered to be a source of inspiration for Kemalists, &#x2018;openly admire(s) Western ideas for the sake of national progress&#x2019; and blames Islamists for the backwardness of the society (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-101">Ergin, 2010: 253</xref>). The Islamist character, on the other hand, openly criticizes the West(ern Europe) for posing political and cultural threats against Islam, and stigmatizes pro-Western/Kemalist Turks as &#x2018;the slaves of the ruthless European culture&#x2019; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-101">Ergin, 2010: 255</xref>). Ergin&#x2019;s research is particularly valuable as it reminds that the Republican reforms failed to homogenize the Turkish public; they instead resulted in a sharp division of the society still visible today.</p>
                <p>Finally, the literature poses the question of whether the Republican regime viewed Europe as its other, since it was essentially nationalistic. 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-45">Bora (1997: 58)</xref> answers by saying an unqualified &#x2018;no&#x2019;. He claims that Turkey did not have any &#x2018;external others&#x2019; especially in the initial years of the Republic. The main purpose of the Republican elite was to establish a new Turkish identity comprising Western identity which made it impossible to view Europe or the West as Turkey&#x2019;s other (Ibid). 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-45">Bora (1997: 58)</xref> quotes the words of Hamdullah Suphi; &#x201c;In the Turkish Revolution, Europe was defeated, but Europeannes became victorious&#x201d;. Similarly, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-313">Zarakol (2010)</xref> explains that the reforms fueling Turkish nationalism were considered in sync with European identity. Turkish nationalist formations such as 
                    <italic toggle="yes">T&#x00fc;rk Ocaklar&#x0131;</italic> were ordered to operate according to the dual principles of nationalism and Westernization. The words of its founder, Hamdullah Suphi are quoted by 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-313">Zarakol (2010: 144)</xref> too as evidence for it: &#x201c;We only became aware of our Turkishness when we approached Europeanness, and we will be Turks as long as we feel European&#x201d;. Likewise, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-129">Heper (2004: 4)</xref> claims that founders of the Republic aimed to create a &#x2018;new Turk&#x2019; free from religious dogmas, the main reason behind the demise of the Ottoman Empire. A &#x2018;new Turk&#x2019; was created through the adoption of Western norms and European values (

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-69">Clark (2013: 207)</xref> claims that Atat&#x00fc;rk launched a &#x201c;pure Turkish&#x201d; movement to free the language from Arabic and Persian vocabulary and grammar, introduced a Roman alphabet to replace the Arabic script, and rejected the Arabo- Persianate literary tradition in favor of the European. 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-69">Clark (2013: 207&#x2013;8)</xref> argues that in such a political environment, one might assume that the Republican regime would reject European writers such as

                    <italic toggle="yes">Farr&#x00e8;re</italic> who idealized Ottoman Muslim Turkey; but on the contrary, both writers were commended by the Turkish government for their invaluable contributions to Turkish literature. On the other hand, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-6">Akt&#x00fc;rk (2007)</xref> claims the opposite. Researching Turkish history textbooks published during the republican era, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-6">Akt&#x00fc;rk (2007: 350)</xref> argues: &#x2018;many tropes of official Turkish historiography depict Turks as the opposite of Europeans, therefore, not only non-European, but anti-European&#x2019;. However, he does not necesarily explain how &#x2018;pan-Turkist&#x2019; rhetoric in history text books also translates into an &#x2018;anti-European&#x2019; discourse.</p>

                <title>The focal issues</title>
                <p>The four focal issues under scrutiny of the project, namely civilization, status in international society, nationalism and state-citizen relations have certain reflections in the prevailing literature. First of all, there is a dominant tendency in the scholarly literature to examine the focal issues through the prism of Republican Westernization and Turkish reflections on it, while there is a comparably less focus on European perspectives. Second, the extant literature shows a remarkably more attention to civilization and status in international society than nationalism and state-society relations. The Republican reforms were largely associated with the Turkish aspiration to locate the new Turkish Republic in the Western civilization and gain international recognition as a Western power while denying the Islamic tradition reminiscent of the Old Turkey, i.e. the Ottomans. Although not as popular as civilization and status in international society, nationalism proves to be another popular term highlighted in the literature, since the nationalistic nature of Republican reforms is widely debated. Besides, it is even possible to trace overlaps among focal issues for most scholarly works emphasize the tendency of the Kemalist elite to justify nationalist deeds with entering &#x2018;civilization&#x2019; and gaining international recognition (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-29">Ayt&#x00fc;rk, 2004</xref>; 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-34">Barlas &amp; G&#x00fc;ven&#x00e7;, 2009</xref>;

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-235">Polat, 2006</xref>). In this respect, the Republican inclination to develop a &#x2018;pro-European&#x2019; nationalism could be interpreted as a desire to be part of the Western civilization and gain international legitimacy. Finally, in comparison to the first three focal issues, there is a relatively less attention to state-citizen relations. Here, the focus is rather on the suppression of non-Turkish identities with a particular emphasis on the Greek-Turkish population exchange, the Sheikh Said rebellion and the Capital levy, while there is a clear gap in the literature on how Europeans approached these events and how European perceptions on Turks were affected by these developments.</p>

                        <italic toggle="yes">Civilization</italic>
                    </bold>. There is a considerable amount of reference to &#x2018;civilization&#x2019; in the literature, since the main goal of the Turkish Republic was determined by Atat&#x00fc;rk as &#x2018;reaching the level of contemporary civilizations&#x2019;. Key developments in the Republican era such as the abrogation of Sultanate and Caliphate, the adoption of Latin alphabet and Western-style education, and the development of Football in Turkey, the establishment of the Turkish Opera were the main focus of the scholarly literature to denote the resoluteness of the Republican elite for a pro-Western transformation of the society in order to &#x2018;enter civilization&#x2019;. 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-45">Bora (1997: 58)</xref> explains that the Ottomans and Islam, meaning the old Turkey, were viewed as the &#x2018;other&#x2019; of the new Republic. Therefore, Republican reforms aimed to dismantle the old regime by erasing its traces from the state apparatus. For instance, the adoption of Latin alphabet is considered by many as an attempt to purify Turkish language from Arabic and Islamic elements (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-29">Ayt&#x00fc;rk, 2004</xref>;

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-69">Clark, 2013</xref>). Similarly, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-313">Zarakol (2010: 147)</xref> explains that the headgear reform was viewed as the symbol of the new Turkey, while the fez was associated with the old Turkey as &#x2018;a symbol of ignorance, backwardness, fundamentalism, and hatred of civilization&#x2019;. According to 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-177">Lewis (1961: 410)</xref>, the Headgear revolution and others promoting Western attire were particularly justified with reference to &#x2018;civilization&#x2019;. Islamic dress was condemned as the reflection of backwardness and religious dogmas; instead, Western-style dress was introduced as the reflection of a civilized Turkish society (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-177">Lewis, 1961: 411</xref>). 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-273">Tekeli (1998: 165)</xref> offers an intriguing perspective discussing the Republican logic behind the changing of the Turkish capital from Istanbul to Ankara. He considers the change as a radical decision, since Istanbul had proved to be the most Westernized city of the Ottomans (Ibid).

This protectionism primarily stemmed from the uncertainty of the Republican elite about the effects of Westernization in Turkey (Ibid). That&#x2019;s why Westernization was both considered as &#x2018;necessary&#x2019; and &#x2018;dangerous&#x2019; at the same time (

Therefore, the Republican reforms were not only introduced with the objective of catching up with the Western civilization and gaining international status, but also with the particular aim of mobilizing the masses under Turkish nationalism and even Pan-Turkism. For instance, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-269">Tachau (1964: 200&#x2013;201)</xref> argues that the adoption of Latin alphabet and other language reforms were mainly geared towards fueling nationalism into the society with the aim of purifying the Turkish identity from foreign elements. Republican inventions such as Sun-Language Theory claiming Turkish as the mother of all languages were viewed as a remedy for treating the inferiority complex &#x2018;instilled by the prejudices of European historians&#x2019; (1964: 202). Similarly,

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-29">Ayt&#x00fc;rk, 2004: 11</xref>). Moreover, Turkish linguists worked on the state sponsored &#x2018;Sun-Language Theory&#x2019; to prove that Turkish was &#x2018;the mother of all languages&#x2019; (

He claims that Atat&#x00fc;rk&#x2019;s formulation of Turkish identity was not based on European values, but it was rather built upon &#x2018;a myth of origins in Central Asia, which was construed as being implicitly supportive of "Turkic imperial" imagination&#x2019; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-6">Akt&#x00fc;rk, 2007: 349</xref>). The Ottoman legacy was denied since &#x2018;the Ottomans were associated with religious obscurantism, a decadent cosmopolitanism that had corrupted the Turkish "essence" with Arab and Persian elements, scientific and economic backwardness, military defeat, and collaboration with foreign invaders&#x2019; (

After the death of Atat&#x00fc;rk, Turkey under &#x0130;smet &#x0130;n&#x00f6;n&#x00fc; rather invested in the exploration of the Greco-Roman roots of Turkish identity, through the translation and official dissemination of Western classics from ancient Greek and Latin (

                <p>On the other hand, litrrature also focuses on Turkey&#x2019;s open-door policy to Nazi-persecuted Jewish scientists rather as a positive example. There is a vast literature on how Turkey opened its borders to brilliant Jews running away from the Nazi Germany for humanitarian reasons (

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-103">Ergin (2009: 111)</xref>, since it was believed that &#x201c;&#x00e9;migr&#x00e9;s would rekindle a new Renaissance in Turkey and bestow European modernity to its rightful owners in its own cradle&#x201d;. The Republican regime was particularly persistent to use these scholars in its quest for dicovering &#x201c;Turkish essences in historical, linguistic and racial studies&#x201d; (

                <p>These events provide concrete examples for the representations of Republican Turkey in Europe. However, despite numerous academic sources dwelling on these key events, there is no scholarly work discussing how these events (re)shaped the European perceptions of Turkey.</p>
                <p>Overall, the prevailing literature treats the identity representations of Europeans and Turks rather separately. It either concentrates on how Europeans viewed Republican Turks in comparison to the historical image of Turks, or how Republican Turks viewed the West/Europe. A comparative study is necessary for scrutinizing how certain events during the period (re)shaped the perceptions of Turks and Europeans towards each other. Besides, there is a need for a study particularly focusing on how the Republican reforms affected the Turkish image in Europe. The events in the Republican era, mentioned above, provide a solid basis for researching the European approach to Turkish identity and culture, but the existing academic sources evaluating these events rather overlook this aspect in their analyses.</p>

            <title>The Third Period (1946&#x2013;1998)</title>
            <p>The third period (1946&#x2013;1998) starts with the end of the Second World War and lasts until the officialization of Turkey&#x2019;s EU membership candidacy. Major political developments that took place during this period include Turkey&#x2019;s memberships in Western institutions such as the Council of Europe (1949) and NATO (1952), the signature of the Ankara Association Agreement initiating Turkey&#x2019;s European vocation (1963), military coups in Turkey including the ones in 1960 and 1980 that damaged Turkey&#x2019;s democratic credentials and the Luxembourg European Council in 1997 that denied EU candidacy to Turkey, amongst others. Moreover, key cultural developments during this period include the arrival of the first wave of Turkish guest workers in Germany (1961), Turkey&#x2019;s first participation at the Eurovision Song Contest in Stockholm (1975), the release of the movie Midnight Express (1978) and Turkish oil wrestling became popular in Europe (1997). Apart from key events, there are also notable visits including the visits of &#x0130;smet &#x0130;n&#x00f6;n&#x00fc;, S&#x00fc;leyman Demirel, Turgut &#x00d6;zal and Tansu &#x00c7;iller to Europe, and the visits of Konrad Adenauer, Charles de Gaulle, Elizabeth II, Richard von Weizs&#x00e4;cker and Margaret Thatcher to Turkey. These events and visits constitute crucial drivers of political and cultural interactions between Turkey and Europe. </p>
            <p>The extant literature divides this period into two, namely the Cold War and post-Cold War periods, and traces shifts in the representations of Turkey in Europe and vice versa. The literature particularly indicates a remarkable shift in European political discourses on Turkey after the Cold War. While Turkey&#x2019;s Europeanness was not necesarily questioned by Europeans during the Cold War security context, Europeans increasingly questioned Turkey&#x2019;s European credentials after the end of the Cold War (

On the other hand, the extant literature does not indicate such a drastic change in the representations of Europe in Turkey. Turks continued to perceive Europe both as a source of inspiration and anxiety in the post-Cold War era (

However, similar to the previous periods, there is still a lack of a detailed analysis on how Europe was perceived in Turkey and how Turkey was received by European society in a comparative fashion. There is hence an evident necessity for a comprehensive comparative study.</p>
            <p>The extant scholarly literature during the third period is overwhelmingly informed by Politics and IR (

            <p>The methodological gap in the previous period indicating a lack of (critical) discourse analysis based on comprehensive field research continues to be the case in this period. The bulk of the scholarly literature that claims to analyze political discourses in Turkey and Europe does not necessarily rely on original data. Although several studies scrutinize political discourses with reference to the speeches of prominent political figures in Turkey such as Turgut &#x00d6;zal, &#x0130;smet &#x0130;n&#x00f6;n&#x00fc;, S&#x00fc;leyman Demirel, Necmeddin Erbakan, Feridun Cemal Erkin and Fatin R&#x00fc;&#x015f;t&#x00fc; Zorlu (

                <title>European representations of turkey</title>
                <p>The prevailing literature traces certain changes in the representation of Turkey in European politics following the end of the Cold War. European political elite refrained from approaching Turkey from an identity perspective due to the intensive security context of the Cold War. Therefore, European approaches to Turkey were primarily informed by security rather than identity. This facilitated Turkey&#x2019;s inclusion in the emerging European security community. However, the post-Cold War political context necessitated Europeans to redefine the identity of Europe, which then triggered debates about Turkey&#x2019;s place in Europe. Contrary to politics, European society however did not necessarily adopt a pragmatic approach to Turkey&#x2019;s identity during the Cold War, since European literature and press depicted Turkey as &#x2018;non-European&#x2019;, and this trend continued after the end of the Cold War.</p>

                    </bold>. The scholarly literature traces three main tendencies regarding the Cold War imagery of Turkey in Europe. First, the Cold War context forced European governments to view Turkey as a necessary ally against the Soviet threat. Therefore, without questioning its &#x2018;Europeanness&#x2019;, Europe accepted Turkey as an integral part of the European security community (

Finally, the difficult encounters between Turkish immigrants and European public were directly translated into the European perceptions of Turkey (

                <p>European society&#x2019;s understanding of Turkey and Turks during the Cold War was, however, very different from European politicians. The prevailing scholarly literature contends that Turks and Turkey were rather depicted in European novels, press and cinema as the &#x2018;other&#x2019; highly affirmative of the historical image attributed to Turks. 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-20">Ayd&#x0131;n (2003)</xref> highlights two major tendencies in European novels, magazines, and cinema. First, the historical image of Turks as barbarians and Islamic fanatics were retained during the Cold War with a particular reference to the Crusades, the Fall of Constantinople, the Greek War of Independence, the Crimean War, and the Armenian Genocide (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-20">Ayd&#x0131;n, 2003: 314</xref>). Second, depiction of Turks in European literary texts was influenced by Turkey&#x2019;s policies during the Cold War. For instance, in reaction to the Turkish policy of hashish production under state control in the 1960s and 1970s, Turks were increasingly depicted as drug-dealers in European and American novels (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-20">Ayd&#x0131;n, 2003: 313</xref>). Similarly, the 1980 coup made an impact on the representations of Turks in European novels. While, Turkish security forces were portrayed as &#x2018;unprofessional&#x2019;, &#x2018;incompetent&#x2019;, &#x2018;clumsy&#x2019; and open to bribery in the 1960s novels, Turkish soldiers during the 1980 coup were described as &#x2018;Mongol overlords crushing rustics under armed heels&#x2019; (

                    </bold>. The bulk of the extant literature regarding the European perceptions concentrates on the post-Cold War period. It is possible to trace two tendencies in the scholarly literature. First, politics-wise, the main argument is that the end of the Cold War shifted Europe&#x2019;s focus from security to identity which put Turkey in an awkward position. Since the post-Cold War political environment led Europe to redefine its identity, Europeans increasingly questioned Turkey&#x2019;s Europeanness. Second, scholarly works reveal a continued tendency in European press to depict Turkey as the other.</p>

While considered within the European community during the Cold War that prioritized security over identity, Turkey found it difficult to locate itself in Europe after the Cold War (

The post-Cold War security understanding of Europe was not only based on the security of physical borders, but also on the objective of securing &#x2018;a newly defined&#x2019; European identity and rediscovering &#x2018;the notions of 'Europeanness' that were repressed at the start of the Cold War&#x2019; (

Therefore, in the absence of the Cold War security parameters, the perceptions of the 'Turk' as the 'other' of the European identity, &#x2018;deeply embedded in the European consciousness&#x2019;, resurfaced, and determined the EU&#x2019;s policies towards Turkey in the post-Cold War era (

                <title>Turkish representations of europe</title>
                <p>The extant literature on the representation of Europe in Turkey compared the Cold War and the post-Cold War political contexts too. However, contrary to the European perceptions, Turkish perceptions did not considerably change after the Cold War. The overwhelming argument highlighted in the literature is that Turks considered Europe both as a source of inspiration and anxiety during the Cold War and this trend continued in the post-Cold War era. A notable difference between the two periods is the rising Eurosceptic reactions of Turkish political elite against the changing European attitudes towards Turkey after the Cold War.</p>

                    </bold>. During the Cold War, the literature essentially offers two readings of Turkish approach to Europe: Europe as a model but also as a source of anxiety, and Europe as a threat. Similar to the Republican period, Turkish political elite during the Cold War idealized Europe as an ideal despite reservations against its imperialist nature. According to 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-265">Stone (2002: 197&#x2013;198)</xref>, Turkish perceptions on Europe hardly changed much from the late Ottoman period onwards. Europe has always been considered as a &#x2018;financial powerhouse&#x2019; and a &#x2018;motor of modernity&#x2019; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-265">Stone, 2002: 198</xref>). However, what 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-265">Stone (2002)</xref> overlooks is the anxieties Turks felt against Europe. 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-43">Bilgin and Bilgi&#x00e7; (2012)</xref> offer a more elaborate perspective highlighting the ambivalence in the discourses of Turkish policymakers representing the EU/rope both as a source of inspiration and anxiety. According to 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-43">Bilgin and Bilgi&#x00e7; (2012: 121)</xref>, Turkish political elite considered EEC membership as a means to join the Western civilization. However, from mid-1970s onwards, Turkish policy makers tended to approach Europe not only as a source of inspiration but also as a source of anxiety, especially in response to the EEC&#x2019;s &#x2018;pro-Greek&#x2019; attitude towards the Cyprus problem and its favourable stance towards the Greek accession (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-43">Bilgin &amp; Bilgi&#x00e7;, 2012: 115</xref>). Similarly, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-233">Pesmazoglu (1997: 149)</xref> argues that while Turkey embraced Europe as a role model, European criticisms of human rights abuses in Turkey were dismissed as racist, and the Western criticisms of the Armenian issue and the Cyprus problem were charged with orientalism among Turkish intelligensia. 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-179">Macmillan (2013: 142&#x2013;143)</xref> traces a similar tendency among Turkish political elite who viewed Europe both as a model of civilization, and a threat to national sovereignty and culture.</p>

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-257">Sezer (2010)</xref> joins the Turkish-European identity debate examining the works of two influential writers of twentieth-century Turkish literature, Ahmet Hamdi Tanp&#x0131;nar (1901&#x2013;1962) and Peyami Safa (1899&#x2013;1961). Safa&#x2019;s post-1945 writings define two different Europes, &#x2018;the old, purely mechanistic, positivistic and technological Europe as opposed to the new, more spiritually-oriented Europe which nevertheless suffers at the hands of an unstoppable spiritual crisis&#x2019; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-257">Sezer, 2010: 432</xref>). Tanp&#x0131;nar stresses the necessity of synthesizing &#x2018;humanistic values of European modernity&#x2019; with &#x2018;the artistic and literary narratives of Turkish culture&#x2019;, unlike Safa, Tanp&#x0131;nar believes that such as combination help construct a &#x2018;European Turkey&#x2019; (

                <p>The prevailing scholarly literature emphasizes that Europe was also perceived in Turkey as a threat. As 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-199">Nas (2001)</xref> indicates, 1970s led to the rise of Euroscepticism in Turkey which not only associated Europe with imperialism, but also believed that Turkey would never be accepted by Europeans due to its Ottoman/Islamic identity. 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-199">Nas (2001: 184)</xref> quotes Cemil Meri&#x00e7; who drastically reflected this perception: &#x2018;Even if we burn all the Korans, run down all mosques, we are Ottomans in the eye of the European; Ottoman meaning Islam.

Especially nationalist and Islamist journalists and academics dismissed the &#x2018;Kemalist protect of Europeanization&#x2019; as a &#x2018;diseased behavior&#x2019; stemming from an inferiority complex towards &#x2018;the decadent, soulless, immoral, positivist and Masonic west&#x2019;. Leftist organizations such as D&#x0130;SK and chamber of mechanical engineers showed similar reactions claiming that Turkish and Western cultures had totally different foundations, and efforts to change Turkey would rather &#x2018;dig the grave of Turkish civilization&#x2019; (

Constructing Western-European civilization as &#x2018;the Other&#x2019; of Turkey, these political actors depicted Kemalist attempts to &#x2018;replace Islamic-Ottoman civilization with the Western&#x2019; as the main reason for the &#x2018;ill-state of Turkish society&#x2019; (

                    </bold>. Turkish perceptions towards Europe in the post-Cold War period did not necessarily change since Europe was both viewed as a path to follow and as a source of anxiety. Moreover, the European tendency to revisit their convictions about Turkey&#x2019;s place in Europe after the Cold War further contributed to the escalation of Euroscepticism in Turkish politics. According to 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-165">Kuniholm (2001: 27)</xref>, in the 1990s, EU membership was considered in Turkey as a guarantee for Turkey&#x2019;s continued Westernization and the evidence for its European identity. That said, Turkish political elite viewed European reservations for Turkish entry into the EU as a rejection of Turkey&#x2019;s &#x2018;civilizational commitment to Europe and the West&#x2019; (Ibid). In response, Turkish decision-makers used the &#x2018;Islamist fundamentalism&#x2019; card to pressurize the EU to accept Turkey into Europe to prevent it from falling prey to political Islam (Ibid). 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-165">Kuniholm (2001: 26)</xref> also claims that Europeans decided to extend customs union to Turkey to &#x2018;preclude Islamists from coming to power in Turkey&#x2019;.</p>
                <p>Similarly, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-199">Nas (2001: 185)</xref> argues that Europe was increasingly viewed in Turkey as a guarantee of democracy and human rights in the 1980s, and a &#x2018;safety valve&#x2019; against the threat of political Islam in the 1990s. However, the rearticulation of European identity after the Cold War led Europeans to question Turkey&#x2019;s Europeanness especially regarding Turkey&#x2019;s EU membership process (Ibid). This attracted Eurosceptic reactions from Turkish political elite.</p>

This attitude, according to 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-128">Helvac&#x0131;o&#x011f;lu (1999: 27)</xref> indicates a duality among Turkish political elite towards Europe in the sense that they both blame Europe for treating Turkey as its other and exalt Europe as a primary model for Turkey&#x2019;s Westernization. According to 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-128">Helvac&#x0131;o&#x011f;lu (1999: 28)</xref>, this duality reflected the &#x2018;inferiority complex&#x2019; of Turkey towards Europe.</p>

It depicts Europe rather as an enemy with the objective of dividing Turkey. 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-124">G&#x00fc;ne&#x015f;-Ayata (2003: 211&#x2013;212)</xref> explains that introduction of the Copenhagen Criteria, the initiation of the accession process of the Republic of Cyprus, and the signing of the Customs Union between the EU and Turkey turned formerly pro-Western nationalist political forces in Turkey including the Nationalist Action Party (MHP) against Europe. The MHP dismissed Europe as an imperialistic power aiming for the &#x2018;federalization of Turkey&#x2019; resulting into a national disintegration (

                <p>The Turkish Center left spearheaded by B&#x00fc;lent Ecevit&#x2019;s Democratic Left Party (DSP) shares the reservations of Nationalist political actors. Ecevit blamed the EU as an imperialistic force aiming to divide Turkey with &#x2018;ethnic and religious resurgences&#x2019;, &#x2018;impoverish the Turkish people&#x2019; and make Turkey dependent on European credits (

Pro-Islamic political forces led by the Welfare Party (RP) made even more drastic depiction of Europe in the 1990s. Accordingly, the EU was shown a Christian club, established to prove that &#x2018;the cross was superior to the crescent&#x2019; (

                    </bold>. The focal issue &#x2018;civilization&#x2019; resonates heavily during the period under scrutiny in which the extant literature emphasizes Turkey&#x2019;s EU membership process as a decisive step towards the Republican ideals of reaching the level of contemporary civilizations. According to 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-98">D&#x00f6;&#x015f;emeci (2013: 47)</xref>, the signature of the Ankara Association Agreement in 1963 was particularly considered by Turkish political elite as the realization of Atat&#x00fc;rk&#x2019;s ideal of reaching the level of contemporary civilization &#x2018;by tightly binding Turkey to Western Europe and the highest standards of civilization that it represents&#x2019;. Turkish press welcomed the signature as &#x2018;the most productive and concrete step in Turkey&#x2019;s 150-year effort to westernize and be considered an equal member of Western Civilization&#x2019; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-98">D&#x00f6;&#x015f;emeci, 2013: 48</xref>). Some headlines even claimed that Turkey&#x2019;s Europeanness was inescapably validated with the signature (Ibid). Similarly, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-199">Nas (2001:182)</xref> argues that the signing of the agreement led to the popular perception in Turkey that Turkey was considered as a European country. Moreover, it was viewed by Turkish politicians, including the Prime Minister &#x0130;smet &#x0130;n&#x00f6;n&#x00fc;, as a solid confirmation of Turkey&#x2019;s inclusion in the Western civilization (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-199">Nas, 2001: 183</xref>). Furthermore, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-196">M&#x00fc;ft&#x00fc;ler-Ba&#x00e7; (1997: 18)</xref> claims that the Republican ideal to be incorporated into the West was translated into a desire for EU membership throughout the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
                <p>The scholarly literature also points to the notion of &#x2018;excessive Europeanization&#x2019; during this period highlighted by Turkish novelists such as Peyami Safa. Accordingly, Sezer traces, in Safa&#x2019;s works of the 1950s, both an appreciation of Turkey&#x2019;s European vocation and criticism of &#x2018;excessive Europeanisation&#x2019; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-257">Sezer, 2010: 428</xref>). Safa believes that &#x2018;Turkish-Islamic civilisation needs to be regarded as Occidental and European&#x2019;, since the three fundamental pillars of the European civilisation, namely, Greece, Roman Empire and Christianity were built upon the Eastern Mediterranean, the Turkish homeland (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-257">Sezer, 2010: 430</xref>). On the other hand, Safa also remains critical of too much Europeanization and prescripes a (Turkish) synthesis between Eastern spiritualism and Western materialism (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-257">Sezer, 2010: 431</xref>).</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most vivid emphasis on &#x2018;civilization&#x2019; regarding the discussions on Turkey and Europe is the one offered by 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-131">Huntington (1996)</xref> who defines Turkey as a torn country caught between Western and Eastern civilizations. 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-131">Huntington (1996)</xref> claims that Atat&#x00fc;rk made Turkey a torn country building a Western country on an Eastern society, and when Atat&#x00fc;rk&#x2019;s legacy began to erode, the Islamic revival in Turkey furthered the European perceptions on Turks as others. 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-131">Huntington (1996: 146)</xref> claims that Turkey would never become an EU member not because of its failure to comply with membership conditionality but because of its &#x2018;torn&#x2019; identity claiming to be Western but looking like Eastern. 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-131">Huntington (1996: 146)</xref> refers to &#x00d6;zal who stated in 1992 that Turkey&#x2019;s human rights record was a &#x2018;made-up reason why Turkey should not join the EC. The real reason is that we are Muslim, and they are Christian, but they don&#x2019;t say that&#x2019;. Building upon Huntington, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-44">Bogdani (2010: 21)</xref> highlights that Turkey has &#x2018;two souls&#x2019;; the Western soul &#x2018;confined to the cosmopolitan Istanbul elite and other metropolitan areas&#x2019;, and the Eastern soul defined as backward, impoverished and &#x2018;non-European&#x2019; stretching to the vast Asian interior. This split within Turkish identity largely dominated by the Islamic culture of the Eastern soul is why Europeans consider Turks as non-European (Ibid).</p>
                <p>The literature particularly focuses on metaphors used by political elite such as Turkey as a bridge or gateway especially after the Cold War to prove that Turkey secured a unique position to nurture Western civilization. However, the extant literature remains highly critical of the ability of these metaphors to prove Turkey&#x2019;s European or Western credentials. For instance, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-15">Atakuman (2010: 118)</xref> argues that the popular metaphors of the 1990s, defining Turkey as &#x2018;a bridge between East and West&#x2019;, &#x2018;mosaic of cultures&#x2019; and &#x2018;a cradle of civilizations&#x2019; reflected a similar tendency to formulate a unique identity for Turkey as both Western/European and Eastern/Anatolian. According to 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-131">Huntington (1996: 149)</xref>, the &#x2018;bridge&#x2019; metaphor confirms Turkey&#x2019;s torn identity by admitting the fact that Turkey connects East and West, &#x2018;but is part of neither&#x2019;. Similarly, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-296">Yan&#x0131;k (2009: 533)</xref> claims that metaphors used by Turkish statesmen to define Turkey such as &#x2018;buffer&#x2019; and &#x2018;bastion&#x2019; during the Cold War, and &#x2018;bridge&#x2019; and &#x2018;crossroads&#x2019; in the post-Cold War era, with the objective of gaining authority and legitimacy, rather emphasize Turkey&#x2019;s &#x2018;uniqeness&#x2019; and &#x2018;exceptionalism&#x2019; than its Europeanness, therefore constantly contribute to, in a liminal way, &#x2018;Turkey&#x2019;s &#x201c;othering&#x201d; by Europe&#x2019;. Especially, the terms such as &#x2018;bridge between Europe and Asia&#x2019;, &#x2018;bridge between civilizations&#x2019;, and &#x2018;gateway to Europe&#x2019; aimed to justify Turkey&#x2019;s EU membership (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-296">Yan&#x0131;k, 2009: 540</xref>). However, the use of bridge metaphor reinforced Turkey&#x2019;s liminal status and was embraced by European politicians who wished to emphasize Turkey&#x2019;s non-European identity (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-296">Yan&#x0131;k, 2009: 544</xref>).</p>
                <p>Moreover, the signature of the Customs Union between the EU and Turkey in 1995 was introduced by Turkish political elite as the most important step for becoming European (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-9">Alpan, 2015</xref>). Turkey regarded the Customs Union as a step towards full membership, although the EU never made such an indication (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-246">Rumelili, 2007: 64</xref>). On the contrary, the Customs Union agreement triggered an intensive debate in the European Parliament revealing a dual construction of Turkey&#x2019;s identity as different based on both inherent and acquired characteristics (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-244">Rumelili, 2002: 176&#x2013;182</xref>; 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-246">Rumelili, 2007: 67</xref>). The opponents of the Customs Union agreement with Turkey voiced their concerns over Turkey&#x2019;s desire to acquire European identity which, in their argument, would constitute a threat to the European identity (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-244">Rumelili, 2002: 178</xref>). Therefore, they opposed the agreement since they viewed it as a step for Turkey to claim European identity (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-244">Rumelili, 2002: 179</xref>). Supporters of the Customs Union both in Turkey and Europe emphasized Turkey&#x2019;s stabilizing role as a &#x2018;natural counterbalance&#x2019; to Islamic fundamentalism (

                <p>Throughout the 1980s the Turkish government worked heavily for Anatolian historical sites to be included in the World Heritage List of UNESCO, a list dominated by European cultural history. According to

As security concerns outweighted identity considerations, European countries accepted Turkish military strength as a crucial factor for the preservation of European security.

In response, the EU&#x2019;s political conditionality especially regarding the rights of Kurdish minority and Islamist groups was viewed by the Kemalist elite as a threat to the 'unitary state&#x2019; and 'homogeneous nation' characteristics of Turkey (

                <p>The literature also analyzes state-society relations within European context. Scholarly works emphasize Europeans view on the Kurdish issue and human rights abuses in Turkey, and how Turkish migrant workers are treated in Europe. The 1980

The mistreatment of the MPs from the pro-Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP) led to the suspension of the Customs Union negotiations. Talks resumed only after Turkey complied with the European Parliament&#x2019;s call for reforms to secure fundamental human rights and pluralist democracy (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-244">Rumelili, 2002: 116&#x2013;167</xref>). In response, Turkish political elite charged the EU with &#x2018;Western hypocracy&#x2019;, as the EU was claimed to have turned a blind eye to the atrocities in Bosnia (

                <p>European approaches to Turkish migrants living in Europe have also been an important point of reference in the extant scholarly literature. Having a closer look into European experiences with Turkish migrant workers in Germany, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-264">Straube (2000)</xref> scrutinizes the stereotypes against Turks in German society which directly resonate with the image of Turkey in Germany. 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-264">Straube (2000: 144)</xref> argues that German images of Turks changed remarkably after the arrival of Turkish immigrats in 1961, as &#x2018;[t]he emerging common living space led, on both sides, to myths, anecdotes and stereotypes with regard to the other&#x2019;. The terms Auslander (foreigner), Kameltreiber (Camel-rider) and K&#x00fc;mmelt&#x00fc;rke (cumin-Turk) were increasingly used to define Turks, while immigrant Turks countered with Schweinehirt (swineherd) to define Germans, starting from 1960s (Ibid). Conducting a small-scale survey to 15 German university students in 1992, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-264">Straube (2000: 145)</xref> finds that German students perceived Turkey as &#x2018;an Oriental country that is opening itself to Western culture&#x2019;. Turkish man was viewed as &#x2018;sitting in teashops, sun-tanned, Muslim&#x2019; and Turkish women as &#x2018;suppressed, disadvantaged with regard to men, subject to their men, an appendage of the man&#x2019;, &#x2018;veiled&#x2019; and &#x2018;not allowed to speak their minds&#x2019; (Ibid). According to students, Germans regarded Turks as &#x2018;smelling garlic&#x2019;, &#x2018;with large families and no money, looking for work or needing help here, unwanted Gastarbeiter who take away jobs&#x2019;, &#x2018;workers who we do not need&#x2019; and bringers of the &#x2018;creeping danger of Islam&#x2019; (

However, xenophobic and racist attitudes against Turks increased after the realization that they would live in Germany indefinitely. The image of Turks is conditioned by stereotypes towards immigrant Turks. Accordingly, a Turkish man is depicted as &#x2018;a &#x201c;backward&#x201d; Anatolian peasant, carrying a big moustache, walking two meters in front of his wife, a Muslim of strong belief&#x2019; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-111">G&#x00f6;benli, 2003: 293</xref>). Similarly, a Turkish woman is perceived as &#x2018;suppressed and dependent on their husbands, wearing headscarf, walking behind their husbands&#x2019; (

            <title>The Fourth Period (1999&#x2013;2016)</title>
            <p>The final period under scrutiny covers the most recent developments regarding Turkey and Europe starting from the Helsinki European Council Summit (11&#x2013;12 December 1999), when the EU candidacy status was recognized for Turkey, up until mid 2010s. During this short period of time, numerous political and cultural developments took place triggering identity debates between Turkey and Europe including the start of accession negotiations between Turkey and the EU (3 November 2005), the Nobel Prize won by Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk (12 October 2006), French President Nicholas Sarkozy's speech against Turkey&#x2019;s EU accession in the 2007 election campaign (21 February 2007), and the joint agreement on the status of refugees reached by the EU and Turkey (18 March 2016).</p>
            <p>The prevailing literature in the post-1999 period is overwhelmingly informed by politics and international relations discipline, while historical studies, in comparison to other periods, are almost non-existent. In this period, interdisciplinary studies combining two or more genres such as history, sociology and politics also proved to be a very popular. Sociology remains a highly studied field during this period, while a new discipline, communication is particularly highlighted as an emerging field of study. Finally, the period, although to a lesser extent, is also informed by other genres including psychology, sports, linguistics, education, geopolitics and fine arts presenting a multidisciplinary approach to the study of identity and culture in Turkey and Europe.</p>
            <p>In terms of methodology, the recurring gap in the extant literature persists in the final period since there is still an evident lack of a comprehensive discourse analysis with reference to political texts. Nevertheless, the works of &#x00c7;a&#x011f;atay-Tekin (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-72">2008</xref>;

                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-27">2016</xref>) remain as notable exceptions since they offer critical discourse analysis examining political texts and speeches regarding the European discussions of Turkey&#x2019;s Europeanness. Their analyses hence bring a methodological novelty to the literature indicating the necessity of a comprehensive research on the topic. This project will build upon these works by not only examining the European representations of Turkey, but also the Turkish representations of Europe interactively through a critical discourse analysis.</p>
            <p>Empirically, in comparison to other periods, the literature extensively covers the identity representations of Turkey and Europe primarily in line with Turkey&#x2019;s EU accession. That said, European representations of Turkey is studied more than Turkish representations of Europe, while, similar to other periods, the number of studies examining both representations in a comparative fashion is rather limited.</p>
            <sec>
                <title>European representations of Turkey</title>
                <p>This period witnesses the intensification of debates on Turkey&#x2019;s &#x2018;Europeanness&#x2019;. Turkey&#x2019;s EU accession constituted a crucial setting for the articulation of Turkey&#x2019;s differences from Europe (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-25">Ayd&#x0131;n-D&#x00fc;zgit, 2013</xref>; 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-96">Dixon, 2010</xref>;

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-285">Walter &amp; Albert, 2009</xref>). The extant literature reflects two main tendencies in this period. First, it primarily emphasizes the othering of Turkey on cultural grounds. Accordingly, opponents of Turkey&#x2019;s EU accession often base their contestations on Turkey&#x2019;s non-Europeanness with a particular reference to its distinct culture, religion, history, geography and demography (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-56">Brewin, 2003</xref>; 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-115">Grigoriadis, 2006</xref>; 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-169">Kuzmanovic, 2008</xref>; 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-306">Y&#x0131;lmaz, 2007</xref>). Therefore, the incompatibility of values between Turkey and Europe has been indicated as a key rupture point negating Turkey&#x2019;s capability for EU membership. Studies focusing on European public opinion and press highlight a strong tendency to associate Turkey with Islam and hence a source of threat to Europe. Also, resentments towards Turkish immigrants contribute to the othering of Turkey.</p>
                <p>Second, studies emphasize both inclusive and exclusive discourses on Turkey which judge Turkey&#x2019;s European credentials with reference to European &#x2018;values&#x2019; and European &#x2018;culture&#x2019;, respectively. The literature particularly highlights Turkey&#x2019;s liminal status in Europe which contributes to the competing European discourses on Turkey&#x2019;s Europeanness (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-245">Rumelili, 2004</xref>; 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-246">Rumelili, 2007</xref>; 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-248">Rumelili, 2011</xref>). Finally, a minority of studies reflects a rather optimistic tendency, especially in British press, to depict Turkey as a &#x2018;positive other&#x2019;.</p>
                <p>Studies scrutinizing European contestations against Turkish EU membership overwhelmingly trace a common tendency to denote Turkey&#x2019;s &#x2018;otherness&#x2019;. According to 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-93">Diez (2007)</xref>, below is how Turkey&#x2019;s difference from Europe is articulated to justify its unfitness for EU accession:</p>

                    <list-item>
                        <label/>
                        <p>The predominance of different values is distributed on a geographical basis; such value differences matter to communities, so they are worth preserving; and the difference between Turkey and the present EU member states is sufficiently greater than that among member states, so it is justifiable to treat Turkey differently and to deny membership.</p>
                    </list-item>
                </list>
                <p>According to 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-306">Y&#x0131;lmaz (2007)</xref>, religion is viewed as a crucial identifier of Europeanness and used as a strategy of othering Turkey. Since Turks do not share the Christian tradition, they are automatically considered outside the &#x2018;genetic pool&#x2019; of Europeanness (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-306">Y&#x0131;lmaz, 2007: 299</xref>). Similarly, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-72">&#x00c7;a&#x011f;atay-Tekin (2008: 757)</xref> finds that the discourse in France against Turkish EU entry shows European/French identity (Self) and Turkish identity (Other) as antithetical. French political discourses define the Turkish other not only &#x2018;different (or strange), but also aggressive, dangerous, threatening, and most importantly, inferior to the [European] Self&#x2019; (Ibid).</p>
                <p>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-263">Strasser (2008: 186)</xref> indicates that &#x2018;Turks/Kurds/Muslims/Orientals&#x2019; are viewed as Europe&#x2019;s &#x2018;distinctive others and Austrian political elite emphasize the necessity of protecting &#x2018;occidental culture&#x2019; from &#x2018;a Turkish siege&#x2019; by preventing Turkish accession. 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-188">Matonyte and Morkevicius (2009: 971)</xref> find that European political elite perceives Turkey as a bigger threat than Russia since it is viewed as &#x2018;destabilising the convenient European ways of thinking &#x2018;from within&#x2019; and calling for a revision of European boundaries and values&#x2019;.</p>
                <p>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-25">Ayd&#x0131;n-D&#x00fc;zgit (2013: 16)</xref> suggests that Turkey is not necessarily considered by the European Commission as a &#x2018;threatening other&#x2019;. However, the European Commission&#x2019;s discourse is more geared towards presenting Turkey as a threatening other to Europe when it comes to Turkey&#x2019;s EU accession (Ibid). Similarly, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-266">Suvarierol and Ayd&#x0131;n-D&#x00fc;zgit (2011: 165)</xref> indicate that despite having a cosmopolitan agenda evidenced through its institutional motto of &#x2018;unity in diversity&#x2019;, the Commission&#x2019;s depiction of Cosmopolitan Europe &#x2018;stop[s] at the borders of Turkey&#x2019;. The Commission officials resort to stereotypical depictions of Turkey based on culture and identity (Ibid).</p>
                <p>Studies examining opinion polls in Europe trace a similar tendency. European public stands against Turkish accession on the grounds that its accession would &#x2018;endanger&#x2019; the Europeanness of Europe (

The European representations of Turkey as &#x2018;other&#x2019; have also been reflected into the everyday lives of Europeans whose perceptions on Turkey are primarily informed by the historical image of Turks, European interactions with Turkish migrants and the human rights abuses in Turkey (

                <p>The representation of Turkey as Europe&#x2019;s other is not only used by the opponents of Turkish EU entry.

Turkey&#x2019;s EU membership aspirations set in motion a series of anti-Turkish political campaigns in several EU member states where far right political parties gained electoral success.

                <p>Similar to the previous period, European representations of Turkey in the post-1999 era are also influenced by interactions between Europeans and Turkish migrants. Political and social discourses against Turkey&#x2019;s EU membership have been based on resentments towards Turkish migrants in Europe (

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-189">McLaren, 2007</xref>). In Western European countries, Turkish immigrants are still perceived as foreigners (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-262">Spruyt &amp; Elchardus, 2012</xref>). The problems associated with the integration of Turkish immigrants are shown as crucial indicators of Turkey&#x2019;s lack of capability to be integrated into Europe (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-56">Brewin, 2003</xref>). For instance, patriarchal lifestyle of immigrant Turks that victimizes women through forced marriages and domestic violence is viewed in Austrian society as evidence of Turkey&#x2019;s ineligibility for EU membership (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-263">Strasser, 2008: 187</xref>). Moreover, far right populist political actors in Western Europe justify their opposing stance against Turkish EU accession through the &#x2018;othering&#x2019; of immigrant Turks (

                <p>On the other hand, debates in Europe regarding Turkey&#x2019;s EU membership primarily reveal &#x2018;Europe&#x2019;s own confusion and hesitancy about its own identity&#x2019; (

The discourses of the European People&#x2019;s Party (EPP) members inf the European Parliament reflect a similar tendency to define &#x2018;European culture&#x2019; with reference to (Christian) religion. They claim that the religion-induced European culture &#x2018;constitutes the essential component of a consolidated democracy&#x2019; (

Turkey&#x2019;s EU membership bid &#x2018;brings up long dormant dilemmas internal to Europe regarding how religion and politics relate to each other&#x2019; (Ibid). Turkey&#x2019;s EU candidacy poses a challenge to the established notion of the &#x2018;Judeo-Christian&#x2019; secularism in Europe forcing Europeans to revisit their own definition of secularism (Ibid). In contrast, proponents of Turkish EU entry emphasize European &#x2018;values&#x2019; which are universal and can be adopted by outsiders, rather than &#x2018;culture&#x2019; which is particularistic and cannot be acquired by non-Europeans (

                <p>Debates about Turkey&#x2019;s &#x2018;Europeanness&#x2019; have a particular reference to Turkey&#x2019;s liminal, &#x2018;a partly-self, partly-other&#x2019; position (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-247">Rumelili, 2008</xref>). Turkey is often represented as a country of contradictions, geographically located between the East and the West, and with a Muslim society under a secular Kemalist regime (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-247">Rumelili, 2008: 102</xref>). 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-67">Challand (2009)&#x2019;s</xref> emphasis on the &#x2018;centaur&#x2019; metaphor used in Geman cartoons to represent Turkey proves to be an intruiging illustration of Turkey&#x2019;s liminality. The depiction of Turkey as half-human (Western) and half-animal (Eastern) reflects its dual nature caught between the East and the West (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-67">Challand, 2009: 76</xref>). Turkish society is primarily viewed as divided into Eastern and Western Turks (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-56">Brewin, 2003: 138</xref>). Therefore, &#x2018;Turkey is neither seen as a stable European &#x2018;Other&#x2019; nor as a European &#x2018;Self&#x2019;, but rather a &#x2018;thing on the (European) doorstep&#x2019; (

                <p>Turkey&#x2019;s liminality contributes to the competing discourses in Europe. Discourses focusing on the exclusive aspect of European identity consider Turkey inherently non-European due to its distinct geography and culture, thus unfit for membership. Others reflect optimisim for Turkey&#x2019;s potential to become European provided that it &#x2018;develops economic and political institutions in line with European values and standards&#x2019; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-245">Rumelili, 2004: 44</xref>). Furthermore, Turkey&#x2019;s liminal position resonates strongly with the discussions on &#x2018;&#x2018;defining the frontiers&#x2019; and &#x2018;defending the borders&#x2019; of Europe&#x2019; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-246">Rumelili, 2007: 77</xref>). Debates in the European Parliament and the European Commission about Turkey&#x2019;s EU membership often lead to another debate about where the borders of Europe end and where Europe should be heading (

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-92">Diez, 2005</xref>; 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-205">Nicolaidis, 2004</xref>). The EU can both exert influence upon Turkey by triggering a political transformation through membership conditionality and clarify Europe&#x2019;s identity by emphasizing its difference from Turkey (

This argument holds similarities with, the &#x2018;bridge metaphor&#x2019; and &#x2018;Alliance of Civilizations&#x2019; to increase dialogue between the East and the West. It also negates the claims about British press&#x2019; tendency to &#x2018;portray Turkey in connection with persistent exclusivist perceptions&#x2019;, similar to the portrayals made by press in continental Europe (

                <title>Turkish Representations of Europe</title>
                <p>In the post-1999 period, Europe as a source of inspiration and anxiety continued in Turkish representations with an increasing reference to Turkey&#x2019;s EU membership bid (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-43">Bilgin &amp; Bilgi&#x00e7;, 2012</xref>). Republican quest for Westernization has been associated with EU accession. Therefore, Europe is viewed as &#x2018;a choice of political modernization &#x2013; a source of pride for the whole nation&#x2019; and Turkish desire to become an EU member stems from its desire to have a place in the &#x2018;family photo&#x2019; of Europe (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-400">Kastoryano, 2006</xref>). From 1999 onwards, Turkish political elite, both government and opposition, perceived &#x2018;Europe&#x2019; (and the EU in particular) as everybody&#x2019;s &#x2018;project&#x2019;, a common cause (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-8">Alpan, 2014: 74</xref>). The Copenhagen Criteria outlining the requirements for EU accession was adopted by Turkey as a guideline for its Europeanization and Turkish political elite was adamant to comply with these criteria regardless of whether compliance would result in EU accession or not. Top government officials called them &#x2018;Ankara criteria&#x2019; to denote their significance for Turkey&#x2019;s advancement evidencing the established Turkish representation of Europe as a source of inspiration for Turks (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-80">Da&#x011f;&#x0131;, 2006</xref>; 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-275">Tocci, 2005</xref>). Europe remained a &#x2018;promised land&#x2019; and &#x2018;the embodiment of a harmony between the local and the global&#x2019; in the AKP government&#x2019;s discourses until the late 2000s (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-10">Alpan, 2016: 19</xref>). Moreover, there is a remarkable tendency among Turkish intellectuals and statesmen to highlight a &#x2018;desirable&#x2019; or &#x2018;ideal&#x2019; Europe focusing on what Europe &#x2018;must&#x2019; be and how Europe &#x2018;must&#x2019; behave. Europe is considered to be based on universal values and norms including democracy and human rights, instead of rigid cultural, religious and historic qualities (

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-9">Alpan, 2015</xref>). Europe is also viewed as having a potential to become a post-national polity dependent upon Europeans&#x2019; ability to accept Turkey as an equal partner (

                <p>However, Europe is also considered as a source of anxiety or even threat generating eurosceptic reactions from Turks. Turkish political elite develop &#x2018;anti-EU&#x2019; sentiments in reaction to the EU&#x2019;s representation of Turkey as &#x2018;non-European&#x2019; (

Turkish political reactions to the EU&#x2019;s &#x2018;unfair&#x2019; application of its membership conditionality towards Turkey are embodied in their representation of Europe as a violator of universal principles (

                <p>Turkish representation of Europe as a source of threat not only developed as a reaction to controversial European discourses, but also secures deeper societal roots. Turkish contestations against Europe resonate strongly with the &#x2018;S&#x00e8;vres Syndrome&#x2019;. It refers to &#x2018;fear of plots by external enemies, especially the Western countries, and their alleged internal collaborators &#x2013; ethnic and religious minorities in Turkey&#x2013; to weaken, carve up and terminate the existence of the Turkish Republic&#x2019; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-201">Nefes, 2013: 252</xref>). It is a &#x2018;siege paranoia&#x2019; that delegitimizes the West and fuels mistrust against Western states (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-118">Guida, 2008</xref>). It reflects an image of &#x2018;a conspirational West bent on the destruction of Turkish national integrity with the collaboration of &#x2018;internal enemies&#x2019;&#x2019; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-158">K&#x00f6;sebalaban, 2002: 131</xref>). It dictates Turks not to &#x2018;enter into economic, political and cultural pacts and alliances with the Western world&#x2019; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-305">Y&#x0131;lmaz, 2006: 12</xref>). The Treaty of S&#x00e8;vres is depicted by some scholars as the most important symbol of Turkish distrust towards Europe (

                <p>Especially, the EU&#x2019;s membership conditionality is contested by both left and right wing political actors in Turkey as the re-introduction of the S&#x00e8;vres Treaty to divide Turkey (

The representation of Europe in Turkey both as a model and a threat is also reflected into the perceptions of Turkish society exemplified in football fans who both secure a desire to be accepted and be a part of Europe, and wish to seek revenge on Europe (

                <p>Turkish representations of &#x2018;Europe&#x2019; tend to fluctuate in tandem with Turkish assessments of the justice or injustice of &#x2018;European&#x2019; treatment of Turks. This brings selectivity in the representation of Europe focusing on &#x2018;negative representations of the country by European actors whilst ignoring neutral or positive views&#x2019; (

Not only pro-Islamic and secular segments but also nationalist political actors in Turkey toned down their criticisms against Europe and sought for a convergence with the EU accession criteria (Ibid). However, the EU-phoria in Turkish politics was curtailed following the introduction of EU-led reforms contested by Kemalist and nationalist political actors as a threat to the integrity of the Turkish Republic (

According to AKP officials, this decision proved that &#x2018;&#x2018;EU-niversal&#x2019; values cannot encompass the &#x2018;alternative&#x2019; reading of such values put forth by figures within and/or sympathetic to the pro-religious camp&#x2019; (

Similaly, pro-Islamic intellectuals in Turkey reacted to the Court decision by reverting to &#x2018;their traditional estimation of &#x2018;Europe&#x2019; as a &#x2018;totalitarian&#x2019; project ontologically incapable of acknowledging the truths of &#x2018;Others&#x2019;&#x2019; (

Especially after Ahmet Davuto&#x011f;lu became Turkish foreign minister in 2009, the Turkish representation of Europe in official discourses began to change. The AKP government&#x2019;s discourse framed &#x2018;Europe as inferior and as belonging to a different civilisation, thus revealing a more self-confident, inclusive and Islamist national identity discourse&#x2019; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-179">Macmillan, 2013</xref>). A primary reason is argued to stem from the AKP goverment&#x2019;s objective to replace the Orientalist image of the Turk as &#x2018;sick man of Europe&#x2019; with that of &#x2018;the Robust Man of Europe&#x2019; and turn the crisis-ridden Europe into a &#x2018;stronger, richer and safer&#x2019; Union (

                <p>Finally, along with the disappearance of EU membership prospects and the reversal of the EU-led reform process in Turkey, the literature has recently focused on the &#x2018;de-Europeanization&#x2019; of Turkey. The term refers to Europe&#x2019;s decreasing salience in Turkish discourses and actions indicative of a &#x2018;growing scepticism and indifference in Turkish society towards the EU/Europe&#x2019; (

                    </bold>. This period resonates strongly with the term &#x2018;civilization&#x2019; as both Europe and Turkey dived into heated debates on how to place Turkey into a certain civilization. While the goal of &#x2018;reaching the level of contemporary civilizations&#x2019; remained in the Turkish agenda, concepts such as &#x2018;Alliance of civilizations&#x2019; have been increasingly discussed to denote Turkey&#x2019;s place in civilizational debates. European discourses on Turkish EU entry have increasingly been informed by a civilizational rhetoric that serves to either include or exclude Turkey. The Turkish question triggered intensive debates in Europe regarding the nature of European civilization and the prospects for its evolution through multiculturalism and post-westernism.</p>
                <p>Turkey&#x2019;s EU membership bid especially led to debates in Europe of whether Europe could be defined as a monolithic civilization exclusive to certain groups. As pointed out above, there is a lack of clarity among Europeans over whether they consider the EU as an exclusive civilizational project with cultural, historical and religious referents or as an inclusive community based on norms and values (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-226">&#x00d6;zo&#x011f;uz, 2007</xref>). According to 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-400">Kastoryano (2006)</xref>, Turkey&#x2019;s EU candidacy has served as a &#x2018;mirror&#x2019; for Europe underscoring the paradoxes of its expectations and values involving &#x2018;universality&#x2019; formulated in terms of human rights and &#x2018;particularism&#x2019; embodied in &#x2018;Christian&#x2019; religion. Especially, the AKP government&#x2019;s pursuit of EU membership through a rigorous reform process &#x2018;challenged the construction of Islam and Europe as incompatible identities both in Europe and in Turkey&#x2019; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-247">Rumelili, 2008: 108</xref>).</p>
                <p>According to 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-83">Delanty (2003)</xref>, the Turkish case has brought a major challenge to the meaning of Europe as a &#x2018;geopolitical, social and cultural space&#x2019;. It forced the EU to move beyond postnationality to a transnational encounter with multiple civilizational forms. Hence, the Turkish EU accession debate stands as test case for the possibility of a post-western, a polynational, polyethnic and multicentric Europe not based on the fiction of a &#x2018;European people&#x2019; or a territorial domain (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-83">Delanty, 2003: 20</xref>). Building upon Delanty, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-250">Rumford (2008: 119)</xref> claims that it would be more accurate to view Turkey as one agent of Europe&#x2019;s postwesternization that will help Europe abandon the dichotomy of self and other in the re-definition of its identity. 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-231">Parker (2009: 1098)</xref> claims that a cosmopolitan outlook to the ongoing debate on Turkey&#x2019;s EU membership will help transcend the &#x2018;dogmatic perceptions of inside /outside&#x2019; and can be &#x2018;constitutive of more peaceful relations within and between Turkish and European societies&#x2019;.</p>
                <p>The discourse of &#x2018;civilization&#x2019; is widely used by both opponents and proponents of Turkey&#x2019;s EU accession (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-169">Kuzmanovic, 2008</xref>). The opponents highlight the distinct character of Turkey that renders it unfit for EU membership (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-30">Baban &amp; Keyman, 2008: 115</xref>). Culturalist approaches to Europe emphasized by the opponents of Turkey&#x2019;s EU entry primarily adopt a definiton of monolithic civilizations separating Europeans and Turks (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-237">Ramm, 2009</xref>). Turkey is not viewed as part of Europe &#x2018;because of its different civilizational roots&#x2019; not based on &#x2018;Christianity and Enlightenment values&#x2019;, namely, the common features of European civilization (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-159">K&#x00f6;sebalaban, 2007: 101</xref>). There is a &#x2018;civilizational clash&#x2019; between Islam and Europe raising the question of whether &#x2018;Islamic civilization was ever well disposed towards quintessentially &#x2018;European&#x2019; values&#x2019; including freedom of thought, tolerance, religious pluralism, and gender equality (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-271">Taras, 2013: 80</xref>). Hence, the EU membership of Turkey was equalled by European political elite with the end of Europe (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-56">Brewin, 2003</xref>; 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-159">K&#x00f6;sebalaban, 2007</xref>). The endorsement of such as a rhetoric which emphasizes &#x2018;civilizational divide&#x2019; in its approach to Turkey left Turks to feel like &#x2018;scorned suitors&#x2019; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-150">Keyder, 2006: 73</xref>). Besides, according to some scholars, adopting a &#x2018;fortress Europe&#x2019; mentality to deny Turkey on civilizational grounds might &#x2018;risk aggravating the prospects of a &#x2018;clash of civilizations&#x2019;&#x2019; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-153">Kiri&#x015f;ci, 2008: 20</xref>).</p>
                <p>The proponents of Turkey&#x2019;s EU accession too refer to the term &#x2018;civilization&#x2019; in their discourses. Especially, centre-left parties in Western Europe emphasize Turkey&#x2019;s membership as an indicator of Europe&#x2019;s &#x2018;civilizing mission&#x2019; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-150">Keyder, 2006: 79</xref>). Pro-Turkish European political elite also consider Turkey&#x2019;s EU accession process as evidence that Europe &#x2018;is multicultural, secular, but multi-faith, peaceful and open to the rest of the world&#x2019; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-247">Rumelili, 2008: 105</xref>). Therefore, the &#x2018;Clash of Civilizations&#x2019; discourse has been used by both opponents and proponents of Turkey&#x2019;s EU entry to either discredit its European credentials or support its role in remedying the civilizational clash (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-216">&#x00d6;ner, 2009</xref>).

Turkish people support democracy and human rights similar to Europeans except for more support for religious and authoritarian rule and less tolerance towards minorities in Turkey (Ibid).</p>
                <p>Civilizational rhetoric is also widely used by Turkish political elite to emphasize Turkey&#x2019;s critical role for Europe. Turkish political elite traditionally presents EU accession as the finalization of Turkey&#x2019;s Westernization in line with the Republican ideals (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-199">Nas, 2001</xref>). 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-210">O&#x011f;uzlu (2011)</xref> however argues that Turkey&#x2019;s Westernism in recent years has rather been &#x2018;Turkey-centric&#x2019; especially in its approach to the EU. He claims that Turks embrace European values and institutions &#x2018;based on their national interests rather than their national identity&#x2019; (Ibid). Moreover, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-43">Bilgin and Bilgi&#x00e7; (2012: 119)</xref> claim that the AKP government adopted a rather different civilizational discourse than its predecesor, the DSP. While the DSP government sought to find a common civilizational ground with Europe emphasizing shared values and history, the AKP&#x2019;s discourses &#x2018;wrote Turkey out of EU/ropean civilization and sought commonality in the practice of dialogue of civilizations&#x2019; (Ibid). Hence, there is a shift in civilizational discourses between Turkish governments since 1999 from representing Turkey as Western to &#x2018;belonging to and offering oneself as the interlocutor of Islamic civilization&#x2019; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-43">Bilgin &amp; Bilgi&#x00e7;, 2012: 121</xref>). In this respect, the &#x2018;Alliance of Civilizations&#x2019; project was pioneered by the AKP government to establish a bridge between the East and the West, but by doing so, the Turkish government also confirmed Turkey&#x2019;s liminal position. According to 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-297">Yan&#x0131;k (2011)</xref>,</p>
                <p>Turkey&#x2019;s liminality, as discussed above in detail, is &#x2018;neither created by the EU alone nor regarded by the Turks as a bad thing&#x2019;. Turkish political elite contributed to the creation of such an identity for Turkey and &#x2018;carr[ied] liminality as a badge of honor&#x2019; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-297">Yan&#x0131;k, 2011: 82</xref>). Turkish exceptionalism in the post-Cold War period was constructed via liminal representations of the country as a mediator/peacemaker between East and West (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-297">Yan&#x0131;k, 2011: 80</xref>). The metaphors popularly used by Turkish politicians such as &#x2018;bridge,&#x2019; &#x2018;door,&#x2019; &#x2018;latch and key,&#x2019; &#x2018;crossroads,&#x2019; and &#x2018;gate&#x2019; feed into Turkey&#x2019;s liminal identity and help Turkey formulate a unique position for its foreign policy (

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-297">Yan&#x0131;k, 2011</xref>). Rising Eurasianism in Turkish politics is also linked to the aspirations to emphasize Turkey&#x2019;s liminal position as the &#x2018;center&#x2019; or &#x2018;hub&#x2019; of Eurasia (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-296">Yan&#x0131;k, 2009</xref>). Similarly, relying on the neo-Ottomanism discourse, the AKP government declared Turkey as a &#x2018;central&#x2019; country in world politics (

Besides, Turkey&#x2019;s &#x2018;liminality&#x2019; reinforced through the continuous use of &#x2018;bridge&#x2019; metaphor places Turkey in a less classifiable category than the regular &#x2018;othering&#x2019; practices (

However, the AKP&#x2019;s neo-Ottomanist ideology feeds into the clash of civilizations thesis since it draws a fine line between the East and the West by totalizing civilizational and cultural identities such as &#x2018;Western&#x2019; and &#x2018;Christian&#x2019;, and &#x2018;Islamic&#x2019; and &#x2018;Eastern&#x2019; (

                <p>Turkey&#x2019;s liminal position is advertised by Turkish statesmen not as a threat but as an asset to Europe (

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-9">Alpan, 2015</xref>). Besides, Turkey&#x2019;s EU membership is directly linked to Europe&#x2019;s capability to achieve the &#x2018;Alliance of Civilizations&#x2019; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-10">Alpan, 2016: 19</xref>). Therefore, the emphasis on Turkey&#x2019;s hybridity challenges &#x2018;the binary interpretations of European identity, which rest upon the construction of Europe/Asia, West/Islam as mutually exclusive and inherently incompatible identities&#x2019; (

                <p>On a final note, cultural events including the Eurovision song contest and European football tournaments are highlighted in the literature as important triggers of debates both in Turkey and Europe about Turkey&#x2019;s Europeanness (

                    </bold>. This period also witnessed the rise of nationalist discourses in Turkey as well as Europe. During the AKP era, Kemalist nationalism has been renamed as &#x2018;Ulusalc&#x0131;l&#x0131;k&#x2019; charged with &#x2018;uncompromising anti-Westernism; externalization of Islam from Turkish nationalism; and ethnic exclusionism&#x2019; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-278">Uslu, 2008</xref>). It is different from traditional nationalism (milliyet&#x00e7;ilik) especially in the sense that it &#x2018;has hailed secularism and emphasized the Turkish rather than Islamic dimension of national identity (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-307">Y&#x0131;lmaz, 2011</xref>). It is generally viewed as a loose anti-Western alliance between the Turkish ultra-left and ultra-right around the protection of Kemalist principles (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-104">Er&#x015f;en, 2013</xref>). This new neo-nationalist trend is also defined as &#x2018;defensive or inward-oriented&#x2019; nationalism with the objective of preserving the unitary and secular character of Turkey against the ill effects of globalization and Europeanization (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-220">&#x00d6;ni&#x015f;, 2007</xref>). The S&#x00e8;vres Syndrome resonates strongly with this new nationalism. Associations with this neo-nationalist leaning sued Nobel Prize winner Orhan Pamuk, well-known writer Elif &#x015e;afak and late Armenian intellectual Hrant Dink for insulting Turkishness (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-272">Ta&#x015f;k&#x0131;n, 2008</xref>).</p>
                <p>The &#x2018;Ulusalc&#x0131;&#x2019; foreign policy dictates closer ties with Eurasia rather than the West since the West does not consider Turkey as a legitimate member of the Western international community (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-209">O&#x011f;uzlu, 2010: 670</xref>). Besides, Eurasianism is further embraced by Kemalist intellectuals and politicians as a tool to criticize the West/Europe (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2">Ak&#x00e7;al&#x0131; &amp; Perin&#x00e7;ek, 2009</xref>;

Therefore, the pro-European nationalist understanding of the Kemalist establishment has evolved into a rather anti-European discourse. The sharp reversal in Kemalist nationalism stems primarily from Turkey&#x2019;s EU accession process in which the EU empowered the AKP, a pro-Islamic government. Political and social reforms enacted for EU accession such as minority rights and foreign land ownership were alleged to damage the integrity of the Turkish Republic (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-52">B&#x00f6;rzel &amp; Soyalt&#x0131;n, 2012</xref>;

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-307">Y&#x0131;lmaz, 2011</xref>). The AKP was claimed to be giving unacceptable concessions to Europe for the sake of EU membership (

                <p>On the other hand, the AKP government promotes a different kind of nationalism with an Islamic flavor through the introduction of &#x2018;neo-Ottomanism&#x2019;. The neo-Ottomanist discourse is used by the AKP elite to construct an exceptionalist Turkish identity which is &#x2018;cosmopolitan&#x2019; and &#x2018;multicultural&#x2019; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-297">Yan&#x0131;k, 2011: 84</xref>). Focusing on the &#x2018;forgotton&#x2019; and &#x2018;overlooked&#x2019; legacy and &#x2018;unique&#x2019; geopolitical position of Turkey, neo-Ottomanism claims to offer a more active role for Turkey in its neighbourhood (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-14">Arkan, 2016: 141</xref>). In this respect, textbooks revised in Turkey following the EU reform process continued to inject the AKP-led nationalism drawing the boundaries between &#x2018;us&#x2019; and &#x2018;them&#x2019; based on ethnicity (Turkishness) and religion (Islam) (

Although expected to dismiss nationalist discourse and adopt an inclusive rhetoric thanks to the EU accession process, the new textbooks rather &#x2018;promote a notion of solidarity among the Turkic-Islamic population while paying no attention to non-Turkish and non-Muslim groups&#x2019; (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-76">&#x00c7;ay&#x0131;r, 2009: 51</xref>).</p>
                <p>However, the EU accession process produced contestations against Turkish national identity by both pro-EU actors in Turkey and pro-Turkey actors in Europe. They emphasized the necessity of transcending the primordial understanding of nation through increased social and political rights and liberties for Kurdish, Armenian and other minority groups (

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-179">Macmillan, 2013</xref>). Turkey&#x2019;s Europeanization process also contributed to the projection of Kurdish nationalism into legitimate political platforms through political parties since Turkey&#x2019;s EU accession process facilitated the recognition and expression of Kurdish identity (

Moreover, the increasing popularity of far-right nationalist political actors including Marine Le Pen in France, Nigel Farage in Britain and Norbert Hofer in Austria indicates that nationalism and euroscepticism in Western Europe have been moving from the periphery to the political mainstream (

            <title>Conclusion</title>
            <p>This analytical review has located several gaps in the existing literature on Turkey-Europe identity relations. First, there are very few, if any, longue-duree studies that trace the evolution of identity relations between Turkey and Europe. There is an evident lack of studies with a comprehensive focus on the topic covering all four periods under scrutiny. The second relevant pattern is the relatively uneven distribution of the existing literature across different historical periods. Around 150 of the 313 works analyzed focuses on the identity relationship between Turkey and the EU in the contemporary post-1999 period, while in the 1789&#x2013;1922 period, the number of relevant works is 40, in the 1923&#x2013;1945 period 45, and in the 1946&#x2013;1988 period, it is 65. Thirdly, most of the existing literature presents either the European perceptions or the Turkish perceptions in a particular historical period without analyzing the interaction between the two. In other words, scant attention has been paid to the ways in which European representations of Turkey&#x2019;s identity resonate in Turkey and in turn shape Turkish representations of European identity. By paying equal attention to both European and Turkish representations of the Turkey-Europe identity relationship in all four historical periods, this review is therefore a major contribution to the existing literature.</p>
            <p>Moreover, this analytical review has identified some gaps in the study of identity relations within specific periods. The European perceptions of different moments of Ottoman modernization in the first period has not been adequately studied, and there is a clear need to avoid reifying Europe and distinguishing between different policies and attitudes of each major European power, particularly England, France and Germany. From the Ottoman side, the main lacuna is methodologically informed studies examining the difference and interaction between the elite and public perceptions throughout the first period. Regarding the second period, the literature lacks studies focusing on how the Republican reforms and its (oppressive) actions towards public affected the Turkish image in Europe. Similarly, the third period requires more focus on how European attitudes towards Turkish immigrants contributed to the European image in Turkey.</p>
            <p>Merging the arguments raised in the vast pool of scholarly sources, this analytical review has reached the following conclusions. The Nineteenth century was crucial in the formation of &#x201c;Europe&#x201d; and &#x201c;the Turks&#x201d; as both sides tried faced each other in battle, diplomacy, and culture, and in this Russia competed with the Ottoman Empire as her nemesis. Regarding the European representations of Turkey, the historical image of Turks as &#x201c;the other of Europe&#x201d; did not necessarily change in the second period despite Republican reforms to prove the contrary. In the third period, the literature highlights the European political pragmatism towards Turkey during the Cold War in which security concerns overshadowed identity discussions. European public opinion however remained unchanged especially given the interactions with Turkish migrants. On the other hand, the post-Cold War resurfaced identity debates and reinforced the image of Turkey as non-European again.</p>
            <p>In the final period, the European representations vastly concentrated on the othering of Turkey on cultural grounds. Especially, resentments against Islam and migrants fed into contestations against Turkey&#x2019;s EU membership. Moreover, the final period witnessed the intensification of competing discourses on Turkey, both inclusive and exclusive with reference to European &#x2018;values&#x2019; vs European &#x2018;culture&#x2019;. Especially, Turkey&#x2019;s liminality contributes to the competing discourses depicting Turks as both the negative and positive other of Europe.</p>
            <p>Regarding the Turkish representations of Europe, the second period reveals the Turkish tendency to view Europe both a model and a threat. Intriguingly, Turkish nationalism in this period was largely deemed as pro-European. The duality in Turkish perceptions continued in the third period framing Europe both as a source of inspiration and anxiety. Unlike European representations, the Cold War did not change or conceal Turkish views towards Europe. Besides, the literature emphasizes the rising Turkish Euroscepticism in response to the changing European attitudes towards Turkey after the Cold War. Similar representations remained unscathed in the final period. On one hand, Europe was viewed as everybody&#x2019;s &#x2018;project&#x2019;, &#x2018;promised land&#x2019; and &#x2018;ideal&#x2019;. It was also dismissed as violator of universal principles and Christian club responsible for the revitalization of S&#x00e8;vres Syndrome in Turkish society. Towards the end of the final period, literature also stresses an increasing pace of de-Europeanization in Turkish politics in response to the loss of EU membership perspective.</p>

        <body>
            <p>This is a very comprehensive survey of the existing research on the question of identity in the mutual perceptions of Turks and Europeans over a long period of history. The review is divided into four periods, the first starting with the final century of the Ottoman Empire and the last ending with the Turkey-EU refugee deal in 2016. With this comprehensive approach, the authors hope to fill a lacunae in the literature: there are few studies of the mutual representation between these two actors over the 
                <italic>long dur&#x00e9;e</italic>. They express the hope that their review can provide the basis for an "evolutionary analysis of mutual identity representations between the two sides over more than a two-hundred-year period." (p. 3)</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The authors structure the examination of the literature in each period by first presenting a historical context, after which they turn to European representations of the Ottoman Empire, and then to Ottoman representations of Europe. They conclude the examination of each period by discussing four focal issues: nationalism, civilization, status in international society, and state-citizen relations. These four issues are no doubt interesting and important, and the discussion of them is informative, but there is no prior discussion that explains the theoretical or practical significance of these issues, or why these and not others were chosen. A slightly stronger theoretical framework for the review could have enhanced the coherence of the review.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The review is long and very rich in information. It is a gold mine for anyone interested in a birds-eye view of the mutual representation of identity and otherness between Ottomans/Turks and (non-Turkish) Europeans. This review should be a natural starting point for students and scholars writing on this topic in the future, and the concluding identification of eight major gaps in the literature should point the way to future research. The review is easily accessible and written in a straight forward manner by scholars who clearly know the topic. The focus on the mutuality of representations is one of the strong points of the study, as much of the literature (generally speaking) has tended to focus on European representations of Turkey and Turks. The periodization is reasonable and there were many revelations for me when reading.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> On the critical side, the authors could have discussed the Turkey-Europe dichotomy that they assume in a more reflective manner. Does the use of this dichotomy reify the construct that Turkey is not part of/partly Europe? The review is, as has been noted above, short on theory. A fuller theoretical discussion of in particular the four focal issues could have been useful. The reading of the research is generally very good, but the ambition to cover a vast topic means that the readings of the literature is at times somewhat shallow. There are minor but consistent grammatical errors (in particular when it comes to definite/indefinite articles) that marginally detract from the presentation.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> When it comes to limitations, it is not clear why the project begins with the French Revolution and not sooner. There were, of course, interactions between the Ottoman Empire and Christian kingdoms in Europe prior to that date. The review could have benefited from a motivation for this choice of limitation. Having said that, the period covered is already vast and extending it further could have made it unwieldy. Another limitation is that only works in two languages--English and Turkish--are included. Europe is of course much bigger than just the UK and while English has become the 
                <italic>lingua franca</italic> of academia, the exclusion of sources in eg: German and French might have had consequences for the findings. On the other hand, just including Turkish sources is a significant improvement of the existing scholarship. A recommendation for future scholarship that wants to build on this review would be to add sources in other languages.</p>

                <bold>INTRODUCTION</bold>
            </p>
            <p> Aiming to analyse a period of more than 200 years is a challenging but original attempt to unveil the bigger picture of Turkish-European relations within the specific dimension of identity. The research sample of this article is based on three periods, all of which are important for a better understanding of T&#x00fc;rkiye's relations with Europe. The periods do not have similar characteristics. The first period is by far the longest. It contains so many controversial and historical events that even historians find it difficult to understand. The second and third periods are more manageable, although the literature on these years is probably more time-consuming. The article is interested in four focal points that are useful to explain the historical and contemporary aspects of T&#x00fc;rkiye-EU relations within the framework of the notion of "identity".</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> This article is instructive. The bibliography gathered in the research includes 313 works, which makes the study powerful and unique in its field. The article not only presents the overall picture in the literature, but also presents important but little known details that help to analyse what the article focuses on. For example, Kaiser Wilhelm's trip to Istanbul and Jerusalem and his spiritual experience on that trip make the article more interesting to read. Another stimulating and instructive detail is the establishment of the "Turkish National Council of the European Movement" and the "European Youth Campaign" and the contribution of the two leading political parties, the CHP and the DP, to them.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> One of the original features of this study is its comprehensiveness. The literature review does not only include research from political science, international relations, sociology or media studies. Some examples presented in the article originate from representations of T&#x00fc;rkiye's European or non-European identity in arts and literature. Even a section focuses on the history of education in T&#x00fc;rkiye, discussing textbooks from the Republican period. Another originality of this work is the scope of the literature. Most studies on T&#x00fc;rkiye-EU relations use data from the most powerful EU countries, such as Germany, France and the UK (before Brexit), and sometimes Italy and T&#x00fc;rkiye's neighbour Greece. However, this study also refers to the research related to the reverberations of T&#x00fc;rkiye's European identity in less popular European countries in T&#x00fc;rkiye-EU relations such as Norway, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> 
                <bold>SOME CRITIQUES</bold>
            </p>
            <p> The article summarises the literature that points to the inadequacy of T&#x00fc;rkiye's Western image, despite the huge modernisation efforts in the Republican period. One criticism can be made of the article's approach to the 'top-down' nature of modernisation in the Republican period. It is clear that the modernisation movement in the Republican period was led by the Turkish elite, and in most cases it was a top-down social change. However, the article's constant emphasis on the notions of &#x2018;top-down&#x2019; and &#x2018;rapid modernisation&#x2019; inadvertently ignores the success of T&#x00fc;rkiye's transformation during the Republican period. Although most transformations during the Republican period were carried out with a top-down approach, most reforms were actually internalised by state institutions and society in the long run. There is not much room for negotiation on most of these reforms in T&#x00fc;rkiye today.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The article shows that the anti-EU stance in T&#x00fc;rkiye has not only been taken up by nationalists or Islamists, but also seriously by secular Kemalists and anti-capitalist politicians such as members of the Turkish Social Democrats (Bulent Ecevit's DSP party). The article gives several examples of how suspicious Kemalists and nationalists are of T&#x00fc;rkiye&#x2019;s EU bid. However, the article does not sufficiently explain the literature that shows why religious conservatives (or Islamists, according to some people) or mainly AK Party members had a very positive approach to T&#x00fc;rkiye-EU relations and successfully led probably the most vibrant period of T&#x00fc;rkiye-EU relations between 2002 and 2006. This point is crucial because those years had a huge impact on the development of the AK Party in the following years and shaped T&#x00fc;rkiye's last two decades.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Another missing point in the article is the view of European politicians on T&#x00fc;rkiye's European or non-European identity. Political history is shaped by various actors and institutions. Politicians play a major role in this shaping. There are several examples of the views and actions of Turkish politicians (e.g. &#x00d6;zal, Demirel and Ecevit) in the article. However, the views of European politicians were not sufficiently represented.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The article refers to Gummer (2010) and Vettes (1958) on page 4, while explaining the German and British perspectives in the relevant literature. In the rest of the paragraph, the authors underline the absence of the same topic in the French context. The authors can refer here to the works of Beyza C. Tekin. They already refer to her in the following pages, but this section also deserves a citation. The authors also refer to the Ottoman Orientalist approach on page 9. Edhem Eldem's work on this should be useful and deserves a mention here.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Finally, the issue of refugees has been one of the most important issues in T&#x00fc;rkiye-EU relations over the past decade. The article does not sufficiently discuss this issue and does not show the relevant literature that analyses T&#x00fc;rkiye-EU relations from the perspective of the refugee issue and its impact on identity discussions.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> 
                <bold>CONCLUSION</bold>
            </p>
            <p> All in all, the article is right in its criticism that T&#x00fc;rkiye-EU relations are mostly studied in terms of how Europeans have represented T&#x00fc;rkiye rather than Turkish representations of Europe. This point is important. There is a widespread perception that Turks are already eager to join the EU, based on the views of both the public and the state. This interpretation is based on questionnaires only. Social reality is not always clearly reflected in quantitative data. It is easy to observe in T&#x00fc;rkiye that both state actors and the public are becoming more and more suspicious of the EU and its approach to T&#x00fc;rkiye every year.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> In conclusion, this article is a great contribution and fills a gap in the field. I highly recommend its indexing.</p>

        <body>
            <p>I think that it is a timely and important publication. I have enjoyed reading it and it flows well.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> There are a few typos but small ones, with one careful read it shall be much better. For instance, Moslems (e.g. small mistakes as such)...</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> I suggest the authors make it literature-wise richer, and add resources that support these claims, especially regarding the claims in these paragraphs:</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> In terms of cultural developments, the period witnessed several major cultural shifts in the Ottoman Empire. Starting with the fashioning of the Ottoman bureaucratic system in the European style and the establishment of the translation bureau, Westernization in urban social and intellectual life spread gradually and geographically from Istanbul to other urban centres. Translations were made from European literature starting in the 1850s and Ottoman writers started experimenting with European genres of novel and poetic styles. Consumption patterns and leisure activities as well as architectural style and education imitated European models to varying degrees among the emerging Ottoman middle classes.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Especially this paragraph needs resources to support the claims:</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The literature on the Ottoman perspectives on Europe and its identity dimension during the nineteenth century mainly focus on the tensions of Ottoman reform process: the desire to become a part of the post-Vienna European order and the formation of national identity which gradually acquires an anti-Westernist tone. Westernization appears as both a desirable phenomenon which involves acquisition of military administrative technology, and also as a social ill which manifests in consumption patterns, material culture and alienation. The literature on European perspective, on the other hand, focus mainly on two things: orientalist representations of the East as exotic and backward at the same time and Eastern question, the problem of the fate of the Ottoman Empire and its multi-confessional subjects in the face of Russian threat and subsequent nationalist uprisings particularly in the Balkans.</p>

            <p> Greene does not have the reference and the year... (it shall be added)</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Typo: However, they strategically aimed to either include Turkey in their political and military bloc or prevent it from sliding to orbit of their rivals (
                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"
                      xlink:href="https://open-research-europe.ec.europa.eu/articles/3-120/v1#ref-34">Barlas &amp; G&#x00fc;ven&#x00e7;, 2009: 435</ext-link>). --- they repeated twice</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> When was Turkish opera established? (the year?)</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Please base this remark on resources: On one hand, Europe was viewed as everybody&#x2019;s &#x2018;project&#x2019;, &#x2018;promised land&#x2019; and &#x2018;ideal&#x2019;. It was also dismissed as violator of universal principles and Christian club responsible for the revitalization of S&#x00e8;vres Syndrome in Turkish society. Towards the end of the final period, literature also stresses an increasing pace of de-Europeanization in Turkish politics in response to the loss of EU membership perspective.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Is it true that Turkey has de Europeanised in response to loss of membership? Can this claim be true as a reason for de Europeanisation?</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Turkey is not written with a big letter in the title (in one of the titles). There are such mistakes all along &#x2026;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Conclusions:</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> What is the original contribution of this paper? It is long and detailed and it is highly important to consider these perspectives in different periods but could this paper be shortened somehow to be more concise? Even if there is no such way, since I am not a historian I would suggest Cigdem Oguz, University of Bologna and Hazal Pabuccular Istanbul Kultur University&#x00a0; as reviewers, my real strength is not history.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> I also suggest Raymond Taras&#x2019;s paper on xenophobia in Europe where the Turkish are depicted very much pejoratively in the literature. Maybe that can be added to your paper? Here is the link: 
                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"
                      xlink:href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10848770902999492">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10848770902999492</ext-link>
            </p>
            <p> It is a wonderful paper that looks at the literary works and understands the xenophobia and fears in Europe in general.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Finally, more details on methodology is needed. Which databases were used in Koc and Sabanci ? Some authors not familiar might not know anything about which kind of databases are included.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> I suggest some minor to major revisions.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> It is very useful and rigorous but it needs more details: methodology for instance, Sabanci and Koc premises include which databases?</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> In which periods it has been made? Which papers were covered? Did they use xenophobia also as a keyword for instance, it happens that many papers which focus on xenophobia also focus on the perception of the third country nationals, including Turkish for the EU?&#x00a0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Why there is not the recent data of brain drain emigration authoritarianism?</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Is it the time limitation?</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Turkey is encountering serious problems regarding liberties, democracy and more&#x2026; what kind of perception does this mean for Turkey from the view point of Europe? Where do we stand? I was wondering if it is intentional not to include the recent critical works.</p>

        <body>
            <p>This article presents an analytical overview of Turkish perceptions of Europe and European perceptions of Turkey, covering a broad historical period from the time of the French Revolution to the 21st century. I liked the study's approach to periodisation, as its division into four distinct chronological phases provides a well-organised and clear framework for analysis.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The article is a carefully crafted and well-organised analytical account that explores the representation of Self and Other within these two mutually constitutive entities. Overall, the article is an engaging and valuable scholarly contribution. Its significance extends to scholars specialising in the Self/Other nexus in International Relations, as well as to those concerned with understanding the dynamics of EU-Turkey relations. I believe it will be a reference for many of us interested in identity constructions and the politics of representation.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The study has a twofold aim: first, to identify Turkish conceptualisations and interpretations of Europe, including the evolution of images and representations over time. Second, and arguably more challenging, is to identify the main attributes and themes that characterise European representations of Turkey. This undertaking, which focuses on change and continuity over many centuries, presents a Herculean challenge. The authors skillfully provide an exhaustive and vivid account of Turkish perceptions of Europe and European perspectives on Turkey, traversing four key dimensions or 'focal issues': civilisation, status in international society, nationalism, and state-citizen relations.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> In my view, the article succeeds in its first objective, which is to provide an insightful, analytical and more or less comprehensive review of studies on Turkish images and representations of Europe since the French Revolution. As for the second task, however, I believe that the sheer size of this vast, multilingual community makes it literally impossible to provide a comprehensive account of all scholarly work on Turkey's image in Europe. To address this, the authors tackle the problem by focusing their study on Turkish and English publications from two specific institutions: Sabanc&#x0131; and Ko&#x00e7; University Libraries.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The study's holistic approach potentially undermines the depth of its insights into the complexity of mutual images, representations and perceptions of Turkey in different parts of Europe. It is wonderful to see European images and representations of Turkey through three centuries in a single comprehensive analytical review, but this necessarily comes at the cost of losing valuable nuances. It would be useful if the authors could comment on how they deal with this potentially important loss of information due to the comprehensive scope of this long dur&#x00e9;e study.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The study could also benefit from a theoretical perspective at the beginning or end to explain how mutual representations are shaped and evolve over time. Can we speak of a collective imaginary/memory or habitus that has existed in this part of the world we call 'Europe' from the late eighteenth century to the present day? Can we really speak of &#x2018;the European&#x2019; representations of Turkey in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century? Some European countries spent many centuries under Ottoman rule, others did not. Some sought a military alliance with the Ottoman Empire or Turkey against a common threat, others did not. So they are likely to have different memories and recollections, which are reflected in their images and representations of Turkey. Can we speak of similarities or divergent tendencies across the East-West or the South-North divide of the continent? These are some of the points that I think could be included in such a wonderful account of scholarship on the mutual representations of Europe and Turkey.</p>

        <body>
            <p>The research project is based on a multidisciplinary literature review of studies of Turkish and European identity and their mutual perception starting from the French Revolution up to the mid 2010s. The project divides the review into 4 periods - the long 19th century, the early years of the Turkish Republic, the Cold War and early post-Cold war period, and the period between the recognition of Turkey's EU candidacy in 1999 and the impasse in Turkish/EU relations in 2016. It focuses on four main themes: civilisation, status in international society, nationalism, and state-citizen relations.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> In my view, the project has several strong points: it is thorough, focuses on the (relative) longue duree in Turkish/European relations, and is multidisciplinary. This has allowed G&#x00fc;lmez, Topal and Rumelili to identify some important gaps in the literature, including, for instance, a lack of research on how Ottoman or early Republican reforms affected the Turkish image in Europe, or how European responses to Turkish immigration in the third period affected the European image in Turkey. The study has, importantly, also allowed the authors to identify certain key moments and themes in the development of the image of the Turk in Europe and of Europe in Turkey, and has allowed them to identify continuities and variations over time in this regard. In short, this is an important and valuable metastudy of the research on Turkish/European images and relations. A minor criticism is that there are several typos, spelling mistakes (e.g. visa-versa) and grammatical errors (especially regarding the use of articles. Therefore, while the language is generally clear and coherent, these relatively minor issues should be dealt with.&#x00a0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> In my view, although this is not part of the study, the article could also benefit from a short introductory paragraph(s) which would place it in context by discussing European/Turkish identity and images in the early Ottoman period..</p>

            <p>This article delves into the evolution of mutual identity representations between Turkey and Europe, tracing their development and transformations over time. The comprehensive analysis yields valuable empirical insights, spanning over a span of two centuries. The delineated time frames (1789-1922, 1923-1945, 1946-1998, and 1999-2016) serve as a useful guide for readers, facilitating an understanding of how perceptions shifted in accordance with pivotal historical junctures in Turkey and/or Europe. The authors also explore key topics pertinent to identity discourse on both fronts, including nationalism, civilization, international status, and state-citizen dynamics. A short theoretical part could have been added after the introduction elaborating on the construction of identity. In its current form, the focus points discussed in the article appear somewhat detached from the prevailing literature and theoretical deliberations concerning the&#x00a0;(self and other) identity constructions in socio-historical contexts.&#x00a0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Overall, this is a very well-written, empirical very rich academic work analytically reviewing the existing literature on and bringing novel perspectives to the complex and contested relations between Turkey and the West/Europe.</p>
