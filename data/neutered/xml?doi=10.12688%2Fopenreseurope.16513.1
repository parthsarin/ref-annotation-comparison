            <title>3 Introduction</title>
            <p>The rapidly evolving field of Digital Finance is transforming the financial landscape, introducing new opportunities and challenges that extend beyond traditional financial education. With the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Explainability of AI (XAI), Blockchain applications, and sustainable finance, there is a growing need for specialized training and research that can bridge the gap between academia, industry, and policy-making.</p>
            <p>The European Finance industry, in particular, faces several key hurdles as it strives to compete on a global scale. These challenges include data quality issues related to the increasing complexity of financial data, deployment issues of complex models in real-world applications, deficits in trust and user adoption of AI-supported financial products, potential biases in AI models, and a shortage of talent with the necessary skills to drive digitization efforts in finance (

                </sup>.</p>
            <p>DIGITAL, an Industrial Doctoral Network, is designed to address these challenges by training young researchers in the multidisciplinary aspects of Digital Finance. The network aims to foster innovation and develop solutions to the specific hurdles identified by the industry, including data quality, deployment of AI and ML models, trustworthiness of AI, Blockchain applications, and sustainable finance. The research program within DIGITAL aligns with the strategic priorities of the European Union, focusing on areas such as data quality, deployability of AI models, explainability and trustworthiness of AI, Blockchain technology, and sustainability [(

            <sec>
                <title>4.1 Overall methodology</title>
                <p>The planned doctoral network follows an approach of broad comprehensive training complemented by cutting-edge research projects executed by 17 ESRs. Researchers will not only develop key scientific skills and propose novel technologies that are on the frontiers of big data-, AI-, blockchain- and sustainability research, but they will also build easily deployable solutions to the key hurdles that finance service providers face in using these technologies in production, disseminating this to all stakeholders, incorporating feedback from industry and policy makers.</p>
                <p>The central research question in DIGITAL is how innovative technologies, like big data, artificial intelligence and blockchain, can be used to support Digital Finance in view of the emerging complexities: (i) high-dimensional, high-variety, high-velocity dataset; (ii) limited samples of high-quality data to train various ML models, (iii) no comprehensive pipeline for building and deploying complex ML models in real settings, (iv) no explainability techniques that are specifically tailored to financial datasets and satisfy the explainability needs of various financial stakeholders, (v) no industry standard for blockchain applications and (vi) no common ESG scoring framework.</p>
                <p>All of these complexities are methodological in nature and in order to tackle them, DIGITAL will carry out pragmatic, data-focused, inductive research using a combination of research strategies (case studies, experiments and actions) and methods enriched with continuous cooperation with and feedback loop from industry and regulators. We elaborate on the central layer of the research methodology, which combines academia, industry, dissemination, and training with seven building blocks.</p>

                            <bold>Data.</bold> All research objectives heavily depend on the networks&#x2019; access to financial data (both structured and unstructured) for the different functions of finance: trading (including new assets like cryptos), personal lending, Small- and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) lending and sustainable investing. Data has already been made available primarily by our large consortium of partner universities and industry partners, which possesses a plethora of datasets that have not yet been fully exploited for academic research and business use. Additionally, researchers will be encouraged to carry out primary data collection as well i.e. collect and generate new relevant datasets (eg. through web scraping, surveys and questionnaires).</p>

                            <bold>Preliminary research &amp; specificity.</bold> The network, independently from this proposal, has already collaborated extensively through different cooperation. As a result, a significant amount of preliminary work has been done within the research objectives which has further defined (to a certain extent) the envisioned research methodology for the IRPs.</p>

                            <bold>Two-phased methodological approach.</bold> DIGITAL will emphasise a mixed-method approach, resulting in comprehensive research findings that incorporate qualitative and quantitative data signals. Typically, each IRP consists of two stages. In the initial phase, we apply existing methods to new datasets and transform them into prototypes and use cases so that new financial products can be developed. Once we have these Minimum Valuable Products (MVPs), we will conduct additional research to achieve new breakthroughs and methods in a second phase. Nonetheless, the precise selection will depend on the IRPs&#x2019; underlying objectives:</p>

In order to address the growing complexity of financial data, researchers will use natural language processing (NLP), transformers and attention networks to incorporate text and identify temporal dependencies in various financial use cases. On the topic of data augmentation, recruited researchers will look at convolutional networks with attention and transformers for simulating various financial time series.</p>

In order to address some of the key deployment issues of AI models in real financial use cases, researchers will work on: simulating the real market environment in deep reinforcement learning applications; produce dynamic scoring systems based on complex ML models (XGBoost, random forest, SVM, neural nets etc.) that are able to deal with sparse credit history of loan applicants; and apply (unrestricted-) mixed data sampling ((u-) midas) methods so to align different frequency financial data. </p>

                                <p>WP 3. Towards explainable and fair AI-generated decisions. In order to validate the utility of classical XAI methods for finance, recruited researchers will map the state-of-art post-hoc global and local explainability techniques (LIME, SHAP, LRP) to the explainability needs of finance stakeholders. IRPs will also focus on developing new XAI methods for time series that mark preference for the sensitivities or partial derivatives for each explanatory variable included in the ML&#x2019;s specification, thus excluding the need for perturbation. Finally, to tackle the challenges surrounding algorithmic bias, disparate learning processes (DLPs) and the variational fair Autoencoder, will be applied.</p>

Within WP4, DIGITAL will propose a novel methodology for industry-level blockchain standard which includes comparison criteria, documentation criteria and content criteria. Furthermore, in order to tackle the emerging risks from Blockchain applications in finance (volatility of crypto assets and fraud), researchers will develop a dynamic crypto risk index based on a model selection criteria, and propose network-community detection models so to explore the transactional crypto network and uncover ambiguous links.</p>

Each IRP is established jointly by academic and industry representatives, and each ESR will spend 18 months in industry and 4 months in world-class research centres and government agencies. With this design, we ensure that the progress with respect to the established research objectives is continuously monitored, validated by industry, and in accordance with the existing and upcoming technological regulations. The continuous feedback loop with industry ensures that developed solutions are applicable in the real world.</p>

ESRs receive extensive feedback from academics and other stakeholders, allowing them to expand or shift their research focus and methods, as well as validate the effectiveness of their approaches.</p>

All ESRs will routinely present their findings at DIGITAL seminars, and supervisors will be expected to incorporate new findings into doctoral training programs. This will be accomplished primarily through the new modules developed by the network which will be continuously updated to include the new methods, technologies, solutions, tools, and business models created by the network.</p>

                    <bold>Challenges.</bold> There are both data availability and methodological challenges. Data has already been used, but if some new data cannot be shared easily, we will provide specialised legal solutions (NDAs), and acquire the required licences. Additionally, in case the problem remains unsolved, we will employ data anonymization techniques that enable data sharing or resort to synthetic data generation techniques (GANs). On the methodology-related challenges, in cases in which the planned techniques do not lead to the envisioned outcomes, we will expand the scope of models to be trained and tested and reevaluate the planned effort. In case of any deployment issues (i.e. the developed methodologies are not fully suited to the IT constraints in which finance service providers operate), we will offer the solution as a standalone product rather than as an incorporated service.</p>
