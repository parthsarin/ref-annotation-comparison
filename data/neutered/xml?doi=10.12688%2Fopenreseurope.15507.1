                <p>The circular economy has a huge potential to make our societies more sustainable and decarbonised, with a reduced impact on the planet&#x2019;s resources. The deployment of innovative solutions in the field of urban biowaste valorisation and reuse is still hindered by numerous bottlenecks, such as technological readiness, funding and financing tools availability, quality and quantity of biowaste and regulatory barriers. The European Green Deal and associated legislative initiatives provide the opportunity to overcome the last ones.</p>
                <p>To promote innovative solutions for the European circular bioeconomy and help to overcome the barriers for the deployment of a circular bioeconomy, five Horizon 2020 projects working on biowaste valorisation have teamed up. This joint initiative is named ROOTS - circulaR pOlicies for changing the biOwasTe System. The projects HOOP, VALUEWASTE, SCALIBUR, WaysTUP! and CITYLOOPS are piloting new solutions to transform urban biowaste (food waste and green waste) and wastewater into valuable products like feed, fertilisers, bioplastics, biopesticides, proteins and bioethanol. They use different processes and technologies, but they all rely on high levels of recycling/upcycling and propose valorisation solutions relevant to the uptake of a truly circular bioeconomy.</p>
                <p>As a result of the work performed and experience acquired, a number of bottlenecks have been identified, on the following topics: biowaste prevention, recycling targets and treatment plants, waste and by-products, biopesticides, insects for animal feed, single cell protein, citizen behaviour, investment needs.</p>
                <p>For each identified bottleneck, this open letter proposes specifically 1) policy recommendations for each level of governance, and 2) information about solutions, good practices and concrete experiences from the participating projects.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>The circular economy has a huge potential to make our societies more sustainable and decarbonised, with a reduced impact on the planet&#x2019;s resources. The European Union (EU) has made a significant commitment to this model and several initiatives and projects have been launched since the approval of the first 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-14">Circular Economy package (2015)</xref>.</p>
            <p>As 34% of European municipal waste is organic, valorisation of biowaste is a key tenet of a circular economy (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2">EEA, 2020</xref>). Indeed, the 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-17">EU Bioeconomy Strategy (2018)</xref> sees cities becoming major circular bioeconomy hubs, where biowaste is a feedstock for safe and sustainable biobased products. Changes in the EU waste legislation are expected to lead to more quality biowaste becoming available for use in biorefineries from 2024.</p>
            <p>The deployment of innovative solutions in the field of urban biowaste valorisation and reuse is still hindered by numerous bottlenecks, such as technological readiness, funding and financing tools availability, quality and quantity of biowaste and regulatory barriers. The European Green Deal and associated legislative initiatives provide the opportunity to overcome the last ones. This open letter offers a set of concrete recommendations for policy makers together with information about solutions, good practices and concrete experiences.</p>

            <title>The ROOTS Initiative</title>
            <p>To promote innovative solutions for the European circular bioeconomy and help to overcome the barriers for the deployment of a circular bioeconomy, five Horizon 2020 projects working on biowaste valorisation have teamed up. This joint initiative is named ROOTS - circulaR pOlicies for changing the biOwasTe System.</p>
            <p>The projects HOOP, VALUEWASTE, SCALIBUR, WaysTUP! and CITYLOOPS are piloting new solutions to transform urban biowaste (food waste and green waste) and wastewater into valuable products like feed, fertilisers, bioplastics, biopesticides, proteins and bioethanol. They use different processes and technologies, but they all rely on high levels of recycling/upcycling and propose valorisation solutions relevant to the uptake of a truly circular bioeconomy.</p>
            <p>At a first stage, the ROOTS promoters shared their concerns on the regulatory barriers hindering the deployment of circular bioeconomy. The joint work resulted in the release of a first position paper in May 2021 (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-20">HOOP 
                    <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>) discussing four policy issues and the related proposed recommendations. The promoting projects have advanced providing results and evidences. The ROOTS group has grown including one more project and the 25 European cities participating in the five projects provided feedbacks and shared their views. All the gathered knowledge was used to further develop the position paper.</p>
            <p>As a result of the work performed and experience acquired, a number of bottlenecks have been identified. For each identified bottleneck, this open letter proposes specifically 1) policy recommendations for each level of governance, and 2) information about solutions, good practices and concrete experiences from the participating projects.</p>

            <title>Biowaste prevention</title>
            <p id="S1">Municipal waste accounts for 27% of total waste generated in the EU (excluding mineral waste) (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-3">EEA, 2022</xref>). According to the waste hierarchy, prevention is the management system with highest priority. The 2020 EU Circular Economy Action Plan aims to halve the quantity of municipal waste not recycled or prepared for reuse by 2030, while all EU Member States must recycle or prepare for reuse at least 60% of their municipal waste by 2030. As both targets are correlated, ambitious waste prevention actions will be key to reaching them (
                <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In the specific case of food waste, the Farm to Fork Strategy sets ambitious reduction targets, but it would be necessary to define targets for all sub-categories of biowaste: household food waste, green waste, HORECA waste, agri-food industrial waste, wastewater sludges. This recommendation arises from the fact that the generation mechanisms and chemical-physical characteristics of these streams are widely different, and so are the reduction potential and recycling/upcycling options.</p>

            <p>In terms of circular economy, the future use of waste is much more restricted than in the case of by-products. Moreover, this definition also implies that the status of by-product can be only considered for those coming from industrial processes or other economic activities (
                <italic toggle="yes">i.e.</italic> agriculture) and not for those coming from separate collection from households. This, for example, affects used cooking oils from households, despite having similar characteristics to the oil generated in production facilities. As demonstrated in the project WaysTUP!, the restriction in the definition makes that specific separate collection from households or similar undergoes the waste management route regardless of the quality of the separately collected biowaste.</p>
            <p>The End-of-Waste status is a bottleneck in the application of circular economy. The conditions for such evaluation are decentralised into the Member States, even at regional level, with unstandardized and potentially very long procedures. These administrative applications, act as a barrier for the entrepreneurship in circular economy (
                <italic toggle="yes">i.e.</italic> biorefineries) and promote the use of industrial feedstocks only. Actually, the circular bioeconomy business models of many companies and potential start-ups depend on this End-of-Waste status of the feedstock, the lack of which forces companies to apply for waste management licenses to operate, that, again, can be a lengthy and obstructive process. The recognition of End-of-Waste status should be standardized at EU level for biowaste, similarly to what was done for scrap metals, glass and copper by EU Regulations 333/2011 (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-7">EU b, 2011</xref>), 1179/2012 (

            <title>Biopesticides</title>
            <p>Biopesticides are defined as &#x201c;low risk&#x201d; plant protection products, which implies &#x201c;not containing substances of concern, being sufficiently active, and not causing unnecessary pain and suffering to vertebrates to be controlled&#x201d;, according to Regulation 1107/2009 (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-34">EU c, 2009</xref>). However, biopesticides have to face several barriers for their application as biocontrol products in terms of: durability, risk assessment, infrastructure requirements for their application, knowledge transfer from distributers to farmers, effective integration in plant disease management protocols, integrated and/or customised formulations, harmonisation and mutual recognition procedures for regulatory purposes and the uncertainty about the secure registration of new biopesticides.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, the European Commission following the Farm to Fork Strategy has revised the EU&#x2019;s pesticide framework and set an EU-binding 50% chemical pesticide reduction target by 2030 but leave Member States free to set their own national targets. This support will help to speed up the market uptake of these products.</p>
            <p>Nowadays, the lack of specific regulation for biopesticides means that these forms of biocontrol have not yet been able to live up to their full potential, as currently it takes around a decade to reach the market.</p>
            <p>We propose the following recommendations (

(Bt) Biopesticides are the most widely explored and commercially successful microbial insecticides. However, the traditional production process is based on the use of defined synthetic media and first-generation carbon sources. The approach of SCALIBUR&#x2019;s project is based on the use of renewable sources (urban biowaste). The bioconversion of urban biowaste into biopesticides has many important considerations: (1) low-cost feedstock that increases market competitiveness of biopesticides over chemical counterparts; (2) generation of environmentally friendly bioproduct; (3) minimization of solid waste, thus promotion of circular economy; and (4) reduction of non-renewable resources use.</p>

            <title>Insects for animal feed</title>
            <p>Insects are a great source of proteins and using biowaste to grow and feed insects could unlock several economic opportunities. However, the uptake of circular insect breeding for nutritional purposes faces obstacles like the prohibition to feed insects with biowaste, the limitation of species that can be fed with insects, and the spare number of insect species allowed for human and animal nutrition purposes.</p>
            <p>The projects of ROOTS are developing value-chains based on insect-rearing for feed production. Until 2021, the use of insects for feed purposes was approved only for aquaculture. However, since the second half of 2021, insect protein is allowed for pig and poultry feed. This is in line with objectives of the Farm to Fork strategy, aiming to make livestock farming more sustainable and seek alternative feed materials. Insect-protein could be the answer to this challenge.</p>
            <p>As discussed, the main challenge comes from the feedstock used for feeding insects since it is not allowed to use neither separately collected urban biowaste (tested in VALUEWASTE and WaysTUP!), nor digestate from anaerobic digestion of separately collected urban biowaste (tested in VALUEWASTE). This is stated in Regulation 767/2009 Annex III Chapter 1.6 for urban solid waste (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-30">EU a, 2009</xref>). This Regulation (Annex III Chapter 1.6 for urban solid waste) makes an exception with catering waste (HORECA waste, SCALIBUR), which according to Regulation 142/2011 (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-32">EU a, 2011</xref>) (Annex I 22) implementing the Regulation 1069/2009 (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-31">EU b, 2009</xref>) (about animal by-products and derived products not intended for human consumption) is defined as &#x201c;all waste food, including used cooking oil originating in restaurants, catering facilities and kitchens, including central kitchens and household kitchens.&#x201d; This category also appears in the Regulation 2017/1017 (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-34">EU a, 2017</xref>) amending Regulation (EU) No 68/2013 (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-33">EU a, 2013</xref>) on the Catalogue of feed materials as catering reflux (Category 9.9.1 in Catalogue of Feed), defined as &#x201c;All waste food containing material of animal origin including used cooking oil originating in restaurants, catering facilities and kitchens, including central kitchens and household kitchens&#x201d;. However, despite being present in the Catalogue, this feedstock, which can be equivalent to HORECA waste (SCALIBUR), is not allowed for feeding insects to be used later in animal feed (Regulation 1069/2009 (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-31">EU b, 2009</xref>), Art.11b: &#x201c;The following uses of animal by-products and derived products shall be prohibited: (b) the feeding of farmed animals other than fur animals with catering waste or feed material containing or derived from catering waste&#x201d;).</p>
            <p>ROOTS pledges to favour the uptake of insect-based animal feed by bringing down all the remaining regulatory impediments and further enlarge its use to more species. Recommendations made on &#x201c;Waste and by-products&#x201d; will also help to overcome this particular challenge (

            <title>Single cell protein</title>
            <p id="S2">Single cell protein (SCP) comes from unicellular microorganisms, like bacteria and microalgae, and can be produced in a circular way by employing treated biowaste and/or biogas as part of the feeding and microorganism&#x2019;s growing media. More specifically, a circular growing media includes 
                <italic toggle="yes">i)</italic> hydrolysed biomass (including biowaste) that can be used to produce culture broths, 
                <italic toggle="yes">ii)</italic> biomethane (

                <italic toggle="yes">iii)</italic> carbon dioxide from biogas, to grow microalgae.</p>
            <p>The main challenge lies in the raw materials/feedstock used to produce the growing media. As in the case of Insects for animal feed, barriers are found in Regulation 767/2009 (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-30">EU a, 2009</xref>), affecting the use of separately collected urban biowaste (VALUEWASTE, HOOP) and Regulation 1069/2009 (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-31">EU b, 2009</xref>), affecting catering waste (HOOP). In this case the interpretation of the status of this SCP is more difficult for two reasons:</p>
            <p>1.&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;It is not clear whether the SCP obtained from these growing media can be considered as derived products or not. Even though hydrolysis (
                <italic toggle="yes">Reduction of molecular size by appropriate treatment with water and either heat/pressure, enzymes or acid/alkali</italic>) and fermentation (
                <italic toggle="yes">Process in which micro-organisms such as bacteria, fungi or yeasts either are produced or used on materials to modify their chemical composition or properties</italic>) appear in the glossary of processes in Regulation 2017/1017 (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-33">EU a, 2017</xref>) amending Regulation (EU) No 68/2013 (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-33">EU a, 2013</xref>) on the Catalogue of feed materials (Annex, Part B), it is not clear that the SCP can be considered a derived product, as the hydrolysate or the biogas are used as culture media.</p>
            <p>2.&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;Regulation 1069/2009 (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-31">EU b, 2009</xref>) (Art 5) does not mention any end-point criteria (from which the Regulation is not applicable anymore) for those derived products intended for feed of farmed animals (Art 31), although it does for derived products intended for other applications (Articles 32, 33, 35 and 36).</p>
            <p>In both cases (methanotrophic bacteria and microalgae) the SCP is not obtained directly from the waste, but it is transformed into an intermediate (biogas, hydrolysate) used for growing the microorganisms. Therefore, it is not clear whether circular SCP for both animal and human nutrition can be commercialized in EU due to regulation restrictions, even if the biowaste-derived feeding media have, as described above, very different characteristics from untreated biowaste.</p>

The product has been tested for functionality and safety. In terms of safety, and given the good results for some samples, there are reasons to be optimistic about the future. However, further research is needed on the fine-tuning of the biological process and on designing analysis and quality control strategies for the production of safe high value methanotrophic bacteria products. In terms of functionality, the addition of Uniprotein+ to food matrices resulted in beneficial nutritional values across all the tested matrices. In another functional/safety test with fish, results show that the replacement of fishmeal in commercial diets for rainbow trout by SCP produced by UNIBIO is a feasible and sound nutritional/health strategy in feed formulation.</p>

            <title>The behavioural issue</title>
            <p>Citizens play a crucial role to enable biowaste valorisation routes towards high added value bioproducts. Indeed, most valorisation technologies rely on high quality biowaste feedstocks (low impurity content), while the availability of sufficient quantities represents an economic driver for the deployment of valorisation businesses. Citizens shall be well aware of how they can contribute to a fruitful separate collection scheme (
                <xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">Table 7</xref>). The quality drastically depends on their (and the HORECA sector&#x2019;s) ability to properly separate the biowaste from the rest of solid waste, in order to minimize the content of impurities or non-organic materials. The quantity requirement shall not be meant to throw as much biomass as possible, but to separate the non-avoidable fraction in the dedicated waste stream. In summary, poor biowaste separation is the result of careless sorting, low knowledge/interest about proper sorting, and lack of (adequate) systems to separately collect the urban biowaste or incentive/punitive systems. This can be addressed by policy tools.</p>

            <p>One of the behavioural components related to biowaste sorting/consumption of bio-based products, is related to social acceptance. The acceptance of circular bio-based products is not discussed in this paper for three reasons:

            </p>
            <p>According to the experience of ROOTS projects, best performances in terms of separate collection are observed where bins can be associated to specific users. This strategy allows the conjoined application of reward and punishment mechanisms, that maximize the results in terms of quantity and quality of separate collection. As exemplified below, ROOTS partners that count on the highest quality and rate of separately collected biowaste adopt this strategy. The case of Murcia (Spain) is exposed as exemplary in communication campaign to start the separate collection from scratch.</p>
            <p>&#x2022;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;In Albano Laziale (Italy), involved in both SCALIBUR and HOOP projects, the impurities in separately collected urban biowaste from household is very low (2&#x2013;5% w/w). They adopted door-to-door collection with bar code bins and perform continuous information campaigns on how and why to separate waste. Slight reduction of waste management fees and recent application of the PAYT fee, always coupled with control and penalization (fines) of uncomplying citizens. An unpublished report from Volsca Ambiente Servizi e S.p.A (2022) found that after the implementation of the PAYT scheme, the percentage of putrescible material in separately collected biowaste increased from 86.27% (2019) to 90.22% (2022), revealing an improvement in sorting behaviour.</p>
            <p>&#x2022;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;The separate collection of household biowaste in HOOP Lighthouse M&#x00fc;nster (Germany) also counts on very low impurity levels (2&#x2013;5% w/w). Actions such as door-to-door collection with bar code bins or continuous information campaigns have been carried out. AWM (public waste management company) created an educational trail on the closed landfill and counts on a department of education for sustainable development. AWM launched in 2017 the four-phases Aktion Biotonne campaign, an information campaign combined with the inspection of the quality of bio-bins of each household biowaste. If the quality found in the bins does not comply with standards, the citizens get a yellow card with instructions for better sorting. If the problem continues, the bio-bin is removed and household throws biowaste in the mixed-waste bin, with consequent application of the highest annual fee. With Aktion Biotonne, the impurities decreased from 3.5% in mid-2017 to 1.9% in early-2018, according to an unpublished report from the Institute for Infrastructure, Water, Resources and Environment (2018), indicating that the information campaign had an effect on the separation behaviour.</p>
            <p>&#x2022;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;In Murcia (Spain), a city involved in both VALUEWASTE and HOOP projects, awareness campaigns were the first step to start the implementation of the separate collection of urban biowaste. Door-to-door information campaigns were carried out by the so-called &#x201c;bio-patrols&#x201d; (
                <italic toggle="yes">i.e.</italic> dedicated staff whose mission is to interact with biowaste providers, usually in a face-to-face mode). In Murcia, the waste management company (Prezero) and Murcia City Council carried out specific campaigns to 1) explain citizens and biowaste large producers (mainly food markets) about the new separate collection system, 2) raise awareness on the high value products that can be obtained from biowaste. These campaigns supported the pilot experience implementation of the separate collection of urban biowaste that went from February 2020 until April 2022. During this experience, the average amount of improper biowaste found on citizens open bins went from 4.9% at the beginning, to 8.1% by the end, according to an unpublished report from the 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-21">VALUEWASTE project (2022)</xref>. This decrease in quality is related with increased participation (
                <italic toggle="yes">i.e.</italic> higher quantity) and relaxation of educational campaigns focused on biowaste quality, which were affected by COVID-19. Thus, it is recommended to maintain active campaigns at all times on the subject of biowaste quality. Biowaste quality from large producers (average of 3% of improper waste), was better than the one reported for citizens.</p>
            <p>&#x2022;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;Within the SCALIBUR project, an unpublished report from Las Dehesas methanisation plant, Madrid (2021) shows that Madrid (Spain) has increased the quality of the separately collected urban biowaste from 74.75% in 2019 to 80.73% in 2021 thanks to the continuous ongoing social awareness campaigns and engagement activities run by the city Council (&#x201c;Acierta con la org&#x00e1;nica&#x201d;, &#x201c;cuando reciclo yo acierto&#x201d; or &#x201c;con erre de&#x201d;), campaigns that have integrated the Biowaste Clubs organised within SCALIBUR and other social awareness activities, like webinars (&#x201c;Sustainable Trends and Opportunities of the Retail Sector in Spain&#x201d;) or the &#x201c;Local Champions in Madrid&#x201d;, who are local organizations in Madrid that have the power to influence a positive change in the community and consumers in general through the diffusion of practices related to circular economy and resource efficiency.</p>

            <title>Investment needs</title>
            <p>Following the recommendations discussed above, the regulatory framework can be updated to overcome current and future challenges meeting specific needs. There is no doubt that a more favourable regulatory framework can facilitate the change, but in order to make the circular economy paradigm a reality, there is a need to address non-policy barriers. Probably, the most important one is that related to unlocking investment, either public or private. From this perspective, Europe is making a huge effort in mobilizing capital to foster the uptake of sustainable economic activities through funding and financing schemes, acting as a worldwide reference for the transition to a sustainable economy.</p>
            <p>Thus, ROOTS partners suggest focusing on the following investment-related mechanisms in a way to speed up the fostering of circular bioeconomy:</p>
            <p>&#x2022;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;Horizon Europe research and innovation funding programme to allocate resources to specifically deploy biowaste waste-to-product or waste-to-energy valorisation.</p>
            <p>&#x2022;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;&#x00a0;LIFE research and innovation funding programme to the scale-up and deployment of the aforementioned innovative solutions</p>

            <title>The road ahead</title>
            <p>The ROOTS group wants to play an important role in achieving a more sustainable society through circular biowaste valorisation schemes that comply with safety and health standards. We gathered to provide the perspective of Horizon 2020 projects and speak out loud to concretely contribute to transform and improve our society. For this reason, we must combine the development of new innovative solutions with the necessary dialogue with policy makers on regulatory barriers. Policy makers should pay more attention to the results arising from the hundreds of EU funded projects which constantly provide results, field experiences and best practices.</p>
            <p>The ROOTS group will continue to operate, despite the conclusion of some of the organizing projects. Others will join in the future and the stakeholder community built in the past two years shall carry on the proposals presented here. </p>

            <p># The deployment of innovative solutions in the field of urban biowaste valorisation and reuse is still hindered by numerous bottlenecks, such as technological readiness, funding and financing tools availability, quality and quantity of biowaste and regulatory barriers.

                        <p>I would not call it biowaste generation prevention. In such conditions, biowaste is generated. The only difference is its management strategy. Since the waste is generated and not prevented, I would argue that home composting is not the most circular and sustainable option at some points.</p>

                        <p>Methane oxidizing bacteria and Hydrogen oxidizing bacteria are two types of SCP. The former grows on methane and the latter grows on hydrogen and carbon dioxide. While methane and carbon dioxide are supplied from biogas, they also need nitrogen to grow. Some studies show that nitrogen can be safely remove from biogas slurries, urine, digestate to grow SCP (e.g. see Khoshnevisan&#x00a0;

            <p>The article entitled &#x201c;ROOTS - Circular policies for changing the biowaste system&#x201d; explores and explain about the policies related to biowaste system. The manuscript discusses the ROOTS initiatives, biowaste prevention, recycling targets, treatment plants, waste and by products, biopesticides, insects for animal feed and single cell proteins.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The manuscript has been structured in a well manner. At the same time, it explains the key problems associated with the biowaste policies. In addition, it addresses the major regulations already available and their amendment recommendations. The article has been written good English syntax and is error free. In my opinion it will be a great asset for readers and researchers associated with biowaste management. The article is approved from my side, and it can be accepted for indexing.</p>
