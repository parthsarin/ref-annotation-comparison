            <abstract>
                <p>In 2021 the number of electric vehicles (EV) circulating in the European Union (EU) was higher than ever before. The innovative solutions of the user centric charging infrastructure (USER-CHI) project aim at devising the basic guidelines for an interoperable charging infrastructure for EV. The future goal is for users to be able to charge &#x201c;anywhere, anytime&#x201d;. USER-CHI works towards a large-scale e-mobility market and the development of integrated smart solutions and new business models. These will be demonstrated in five urban areas, which are part of the Trans-European Transport Network corridor (Barcelona metropolitan area, Rome, Berlin, Budapest, and Turku).</p>
                <p>To make access to the charging infrastructure possible irrespectively of vehicle brands and operators, an analysis of the existing interoperability framework was considered essential within the USER-CHI project. Pursuant to this, the Institute for Climate Protection, Energy and Mobility (IKEM) developed INFRA (Interoperability Framework), a study that contains an analysis of the four layers that condition interoperability in the electromobility sector (organizational, semantic, technical and legal). Building on this analysis, the existing barriers for interoperability in each layer were identified and guidelines and recommendations were elaborated. The baseline of this paper are the role schemes, guidelines and recommendations elaborated for INFRA summarized in minimum requirements within each layer. The INFRA results are already available on CORDIS.</p>
                <p>In addition, further desk research shows the latest developments in the EU regarding electromobility and puts INFRA in the context of the most recent discourse. The new insights of this paper offer an updated overall short summary of the main requirements for an interoperability framework for electromobility in the EU.</p>
                <p>In conclusion the current developments underline the importance of the minimum requirements identified in INFRA and first steps towards a more interoperable infrastructure system have been taken.</p>

            <title>Plain language summary</title>
            <p>In 2021 the number of electric vehicles in the European Union (EU) was higher than ever before. Therefore, the charging infrastructure in Europe has many challenges. The EU project USER-CHI (user centric charging infrastructure) aims at devising the basic guidelines for an interoperable charging infrastructure in INFRA (Interoperability Framework). The goal is, to charge "everywhere, anytime". The first part of the paper is about the main results from the framework. The second part presents additional desk research. This allowed for the identification of new aspects that were not, or only superficially, considered during INFRA. As result, the most important aspect to achieve interoperability in the EU is a user friendly charging infrastructure. It needs to fill the gaps in the European legislation and transfer them into national legal frameworks, otherwise it causes wide disparities between countries. Nevertheless, the further success of the massive uptake of electric vehicles depends on solutions that fit the needs of electric vehicle users.</p>

            <p>In the year 2020 the global electric passenger car stock almost reached the 10 million electric cars. In 2020 Europe had the second highest electric vehicle (EV) stock in the world with 3.3 million electric vehicles, after China (total: 5.4 million) and before the United States (total: 1.8 million)

                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN2">2</xref>
                </sup>.  The significant growing sales share of new electric cars in Europe (that raised from 0.5% in 2013 to 10.5% in 2020) shows an increasing number of EV users

                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN3">3</xref>
                </sup>. This growth requires unified standards for the charging infrastructure across the European Union (EU) that allows the rollout of an interoperable publicly accessible charging infrastructure along the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) corridors with charging options at home and at work. The aim is to increase the convenience of the charging possibilities for electric vehicle owners

The goal is that every EV driver has the possibility to access an interoperable charging infrastructure &#x201c;anywhere&#x201d; and &#x201c;anytime&#x201d; across the EU. USER-CHI supports the mentioned large-scale e-mobility market roll out with the development of smart solutions and business models while working on the necessary framework conditions. The five demonstration cities are connected through the key Mediterranean and Scandinavian TEN-T corridors: Rome (Italy), Berlin (Germany), Turku (Finland), Barcelona metropolitan area (Spain) and Budapest (Hungary). Additionally, the cities Murcia (Spain) and Florence (Italy) are part of the project as replication cities, covering in this way several different city typologies. That means that the results of the project will have a higher impact, and gives the possible solutions for user-friendly e-mobility a higher replicability in a greater number of cities in Europe.</p>

To this end, the main existing barriers that currently hinder the aimed user-friendly roll out of this infrastructure were identified and, to overcome them, guidelines and recommendations were developed. INFRA was delivered in May 2021

            <p>This paper aims at giving publicity to the results of INFRA and adds some new perspectives. In this sense, it is based on the results of INFRA and further desk research on the identified minimum requirements. The INFRA deliverable is the main source of information for the elaboration of this publication. The main results of INFRA (role schemes, guidelines and recommendations) are summarized here in the form of minimum requirements for the interoperability of the EV charging infrastructure across the EU. This means that additional perspectives and information have been added to the results of INFRA by the authors.</p>

                <p>This paper is structured in a continuous text, in an attempt to make it more reader friendly. The authors have transparently identified the authorship through citations and footnotes. Most citations from other literature are linked to the desk research (if they are not, a further footnote will identify the paragraph as a result from the input of the INFRA deliverable).</p>
                <p>The input from the INFRA deliverable in each of the  minimum requirements is clearly identified through a footnote, that either states that it is information contained in INFRA or directly citates the deliverable &#x201c;Nowack

                <p>The INFRA deliverable was conceived as a product of USER-CHI and offers a first overview of an interoperability framework for electromobility. As for the methodology, the INFRA deliverable was developed as explained below.</p>
                <p>The layers that condition interoperability were identified. The layers identified as mainly relevant were the organisational layer (global layer), the technical, semantic, and legal layer (specific layers). Interdependencies between all layers were identified during the work for the INFRA deliverable. The organizational layer, also called global layer, gives an overview of all stakeholders involved in the roll out of the charging infrastructure and achieving interoperability. The technical and the semantic layer focus on technical requirements for interoperability (like soft- and hardware). And last, the legal layer reflects the (inter-)national legal situation that conditions the interoperability of the EV charging infrastructure.</p>
                <p>The INFRA deliverable was developed in an interactive process: a) a validation workshop
                    <sup>

                    </sup> was held in each demonstration city with participation of the product developers and city partners to develop stakeholders (global layer) and b) an inventory of technical (semantic and technical) and legal requirements was developed based on the basis of the input of the deliverable D1.3 &#x201c;Technical and Legal Requirements&#x201d; of the USER-CHI project (specific layer). In step c) these requirements were clustered according to the priorities of the demonstration cities. In the last step d) the results were validated by each demonstration city via workshops

                <p>As a result, the INFRA deliverable identified and categorized the role schemes, guidelines and recommendations to achieve the interoperability of a cross borders charging infrastructure for EV

The literature that was found was then used to find similar or familiar literature, that is connected to it (through the bibliography, recommended publications, or references and citations).  The technique is classified as part of the non-systematic literature studies and has been conducted manually.

                </sup>, the number of EVs in the EU will increase considerably in the coming years. This presents a challenge for the EV charging infrastructure and for the national and European electric grids. To make sure that the charging infrastructure is interoperable across the EU and that the electric system can withstand such an increase in electricity consumption, a set of minimum requirements was identified in the INFRA deliverable and categorised in the organizational layer (global layer) an in the technical, semantic and legal layer (specific layers). An overview of the layers within the INFRA deliverable is shown in

            <p>Following this, a short introduction on the importance of each specific layer for the cross borders interoperability of the EV charging infrastructure is made. Furthermore, the identified minimum requirements within each layer are displayed together with an explanation of their role in achieving interoperability, possible barriers that hinder their complete fulfilment and, if existing, concrete solutions to overcome these barriers are proposed. Baseline for the development of the minimum requirements are the results of INFRA. However, these have been updated, and some new requirements have been added and merged with them.</p>
            <p>As already mentioned, all layers are interconnected. This means that, while some technical and semantical essential aspects to the interoperability of the charging infrastructure are identified and described in the respective layer, they are also mentioned in the legal layer because they need to be foreseen in the legal instruments at EU level in order to achieve a charging infrastructure with unified characteristics in all EU member states. Thus, they are also briefly mentioned in the legal layer.</p>

                <p>The organisational layer creates the context and sets the basic structures and conditions for the semantic, technical, and legal layer. To achieve the roll out of an interoperable EV charging infrastructure across the EU, all stakeholders that have a role in the intended practical implementation of the interoperable charging infrastructure need to achieve a consensus on the pursued goals, the distribution of roles and the assumption of responsibilities

                <p>Essential to achieve interoperability within the global layer is, in any case, (a) the involvement of each stakeholder in the organization and execution processes at an early stage to avoid later changes, and (b) a barrierless and fluid communication and cooperation between stakeholders. The INFRA deliverable showed that essentially the same stakeholders appeared in all demonstration cities, 21 roles were found but not every role was represented in every city, and some stakeholders had more than one role

In conclusion, the involvement of each stakeholder in the implementation process (a) could be a challenge, when there is a high dynamic, but also, (b) could be successful, if it is integrated early in the process of creating a network.

                <p>The first minimum requirement is related to the energy supply and the metering devices of the charging points. In this sense, the prerequisites for the physical connection of the charging points to the distribution grid and the requisites on the location of the measuring devices established by local grid and metering point operators must be observed. There are standards and Technical Connection Rules (TCR) for the connection to the grid and rules for the measuring device&#x2019;s location on regional, national, and international level that need to be complied. All these issues, together with potentially necessary grid extensions should be identified at the early stages of the planning process

                <p>The first minimum requirement within this layer is the use of open charging protocols for communication between stakeholders, such as OICP (Open InterCharge Protocol)

Currently, every CPO uses a different authentication system and EV drivers are forced to have several different ways to authenticate to be able charge their EVs at different charging points.

For general and specific applications, different providers of online payment services are available. This situation does not foster interoperability. Therefore, the utilization of an online payment system that doesn&#x00b4;t depend on any operator could, in this case, be a good solution. Linked to this is the use of secure and transparent accounting services

In the USER-CHI project, different products shall be developed and implemented in different demonstration sides. For example, INCAR, an interoperability, charging and parking platform, aims to ensure a barrier-free and operator-independent access for end-users, maximising EVSE availability, improving user convenience and providing roaming services along the two TEN-T corridors with transparent and flexible payment features. CLICK (Charging Location and Holistic Planning Kit) is another product developed within the USER-CHI project, that will be an easy-to-use question-and-answer online tool for the top-down location planning for charging infrastructure, which&#x00b4;s purpose is to optimise the location and planning of new charging infrastructure in cities. Therefore, CLICK will use data &#x2013; like historic data, city data &#x2013; to analyse locations for expanding electromobility charging hubs. Both products of USER-CHI are good examples of a first steps to meet the semantic requirements. The lessons-learned from the development of these products at the end of the project in 2024 will probably be a good adding to the requirements of INFRA and to what is needed to achieve interoperability in semantic layer.</p>

Therefore, an overall uniformity of the legal aspects for the deployment of a cross border charging infrastructure for EV is essential. In a first step, the guidelines and recommendations made in the INFRA deliverable within the legal layer were examined and summarized into minimum requirements. In this sense, a set of eight legal minimum requirements to achieve interoperability was consolidated as baseline for this paper and systematised as follows (see 
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). In a second step, further desk research was made in relation to the EU and national relevant laws and regulations to achieve the interoperability of a cross borders charging infrastructure as presented in INFRA. The desk research on the applicable legislation was expanded to any relevant legal aspect that could condition interoperability in other ways not considered in INFRA (for further information on the authorship see footnotes and citations).</p>

                    </sup>. Until now a harmonised transposition of the AFID into the national legislations of the EU state members has not been achieved. This and the fact that the AFID doesn&#x00b4;t include determinations for roaming for EV charging and charging protocols, constitute huge barriers for interoperability

                <p>As consumers demand for EV is necessarily linked to the deployment of an interoperable charging infrastructure across the EU, the European Commission proposed a revision of the AFID that was included in the &#x201c;Fit for 55&#x201d; Package

The AFID is planned to be repealed and replaced by the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR), which will be directly applicable in the member States. This way, a uniform implementation of the obligations established at EU level in each member State is ensured. The AFIR proposal is also meant to fill some of the current legal gaps that hinder interoperability. In this sense, the actual adoption of this regulation would, so to say, guarantees the fulfilment of this first legal minimum requirement. The uptake of the AFIR will, in this way, introduce some changes and have impacts on different aspects of the other layers that condition interoperability

                <p>Complementary to this is the inclusion of interoperability requirements in the national legal frameworks of the EU member states. In general, the national legislations of EU member states do not establish minimum requirements to ensure the interoperability of EV charging points operated by different CPOs

                    </sup>. This requirement can&#x00b4;t be considered separately from the preceding requirement. Since the interoperability of the EV charging infrastructure across the EU depends completely on the uptake of minimum requirements at EU level (within all layers), the uncoordinated adoption of national requirements is rather detrimental. Thus, the actual adoption of the AFIR proposal, would guarantee a unified inclusion of the foreseen interoperability requirements in the national legal frameworks

                <p>A second requirement, also considered to be essential to achieve interoperability in this sector, is for the administrative approval proceedings for public charging points to be optimised. Often the approval of new charging points in public spaces is competence of the municipalities and each municipality may, to a certain point, establish its own proceedings. These proceedings can be very tedious for all parties involved. In this regard, municipalities should reduce the complexity of their own authorisation proceedings

                <p>The legal enablement of the reservation of parking spots and charging points in (semi-) public spaces is the third minimum legal requirement for interoperability

                    </sup>. However, a uniform regulation of this matter at EU level has not been achieved yet. The AFIR proposal does not contain any provisions in this regard either. Therefore, a first step would be to conduct feasibility studies of this matter mainly at municipal level. An example of the implementation of P&amp;C in an EU city is the case of Barcelona. The municipality of Barcelona developed a public service of parking spots on public roads for charging EV called &#x201c;Endolla&#x201d;

            <title>Conclusions</title>
            <p>In conclusion, the interoperability of the charging infrastructure for EV across the EU can only be guaranteed if all member states integrate the described minimum requirements (from the global and the specific layers) in their legal framework and all involved stakeholders across the EU comply with them. For this to happen in a uniform way (also in terms of timing), the establishment of these minimum requirements needs to be pursued at the highest levels of the EU decision making instances.</p>
            <p>Thereafter, the interoperability requirements of the specific layers (technical and semantic) need to be included in the EU legal framework. Interoperability requires, for example, that the necessary data for a better use of EVs is generated and exchanged uniformly. To ensure a convenient use of EV (enabled by the complete interoperability of the charging infrastructure) the accessibility issues (e.g., of data, hard- and software) need to be addressed uniformly by all member states of the EU. If these requirements are not implemented, achieving interoperability of the EV charging infrastructure in the EU (apart from those countries that are included in European projects) is going to be a challenge. Additionally, and because of the continuous technological developments, regulation must have the right scope to allow innovations, e.g., new technology solutions but as well-set relevant standards. Within the legal layer, there are currently two main aspects that are hindering the interoperability of the charging infrastructure for EV across the EU. The first is that there are still some important gaps in the EU legislation on the charging infrastructure of EV. Thus, some aspects like the use of a specific or interoperable data sharing protocol, bi-directional charging, smart charging points or the cybersecurity of the charging pints, consumer devices or grid systems have not found their way into the EU&#x00b4;s legislation yet (some of the might when and if the AFIR is enacted). The second is that, even though some aspects have already been included in the EU legislation, they have not been adequately transposed into the national legal frameworks of some of the member states. This causes wide disparities between countries. In this sense, the AFIR proposal is a step forward to overcome the current obstacles hindering the achievement of interoperability since no transposition into the national legal systems will be necessary and it is directly applicable. However, the AFIR proposal falls short in relation to some aspects, e.g., regarding the missing obligations in relation to interoperable data sharing protocols.</p>

            <title>5	Outlook</title>
            <p>Alongside all before mentioned aspects, EV users need to be considered more widely. Their convenience when charging and their acceptance of new technologies and regulations is essential for the needed uptake of EV. If the regulations and technical solutions (like uniform payment system) are not accepted by the EV users, interoperability will merely exist on paper. The success of the massive uptake of EV, strictly depends on solutions that satisfy EV user&#x2019;s needs. The social aspects of the acceptance and uptake of electromobility are not mentioned in this paper but could be further analysed in a &#x201c;social layer&#x201d;. The following questions should be addressed there: &#x201c;For which users is the infrastructure in EU interoperable and who can and who can&#x2019;t use it?&#x201d;, &#x201c;what kind of barriers exist and what are the problems and reasons for overregulation or regulation gaps?&#x201d;, &#x201c;which and whose needs were integrated in the processes of developing a uniform charging infrastructure for EV?&#x201d;</p>
            <p>The prospective experiences within the USER-CHI project evaluation processes will help to answer some questions about EV users&#x2019; acceptance and could be linked to interoperability aspects in additional research. This research will most likely help to improve the interoperability of the EV charging infrastructure across the EU.</p>

            <p>This report provides a thorough overview on the status quo of the challenges of achieving interoperability in the context of the charging infrastructure roll-out in Europe. It suggests a structured analysis along four layers (organisational, technical, semantic, legal) and provides insight on the USER-CHI project results for each layer. The study design is suitable for the research question and methods and sources have been presented thoroughly to ensure replicability. The paper is clearly structured and written, although references to project details (e.g. deliverables) are not important for the wider public. Overall, this paper addresses a complex topic and provides very useful insights on the status quo of interoperability of charging networks in the EU.</p>
