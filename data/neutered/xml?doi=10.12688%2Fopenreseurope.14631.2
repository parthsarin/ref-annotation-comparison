                <p>
                    <bold>Background</bold>: In the twenty-first century, literatures from Central and Eastern Europe are marked by a boom of documentary fiction portraying complicity Nazi perpetration, Soviet terror, or other instances of 20th century mass violence and totalitarianism. Since understanding the past serves requirements of the present, the boom prompts the question: Why the interest in past complicities now? My hypothesis is that the texts address convergences between involvements in past acts of mass violence and current forms of participation in wrongdoings in neoliberalism. While these issues differ profoundly, they are related: structurally, both present the challenge of forming a nuanced notion of participation. Historically, they are related since justifications of past involvements have established the terminology, narratives, and heuristics in which terror, repression, and mass violence are subsequently discussed, thus forming the frame for negotiating current problematic involvements.</p>
                <p>
                    <bold>Methods</bold>: Critical discourse analysis is used to scrutinize the legal concept of complicity and combined it with close readings of passages from four literary texts to outline how attention to reciprocity in language can enhance our understanding of problematic involvement.</p>
                <p>
                    <bold>Results</bold>: Literary portrayals of historical complicity are ambivalent; they can help to find models for comprehending issues of the present in cultural memory, but they can also serve to establish distance between present and past to appease the sense that all is not quite well, even after the demise of Nazi and Soviet terror. The article outlines two modes of distancing: a) spacio-temporal distancing of the commemorating point of view in &#x2018;the West&#x2019; from the portrayed violence in &#x2018;the East&#x2019;, and b) moral distancing that casts the audience as superior to complicit characters.</p>
                <p>
                    <bold>Conclusions</bold>: By pressing for analytic or consoling distance, both strategies of distancing amount to a complicity with the transmission of discourses that justify, excuse, or deny mass violence and totalitarian terror.</p>

            <title>Plain language summary</title>
            <p>In the twenty-first century, many literary texts from Central and Eastern Europe portray complicity of characters with political violence such as National Socialist crimes and Soviet terror. I analyse texts written in German, Czech, and Russian which combine fact and fiction; they portray historical events but make use of fictional characters or dialogues. The article seeks to answer the question: why are is historical complicity currently portrayed? Why should it matter to current readers? My assumption is that what makes such texts popular is that reading about what might have driven people in the past to get involved in political violence and terror can serve to understand how and why people are currently involved in wrongdoing, for instance in economical injustice or ecological damage. Taking part in structures we know are wrong seems hard to avoid in a globalized world, and this sentiment can also be found as a dilemma of people who lived in oppressive regimes of the past. I inquire into the legal understanding of complicity and outline that the law is not enough to understand how people get enmeshed in wrongdoing. I show that some literary texts which portray historical complicity can contribute to understanding what makes people take part in wrongdoing because they show the subtle pressures, emotions, and personal relations that cannot be addressed in the courtroom. However, my article further shows that some literary texts follow a different agenda and seek to distance current readers from violent pasts so as to console them about their involvement in current wrongdoing. I argue that what makes fictional portrayals of actual historical events relevant (even if they are not true) is that they draw the readers&#x2019; attention to the fact that how we commemorate violent pasts is decisive for how we understand our role in current violence.</p>

In Memory of Memory, 2021) portray complicity with Nazi perpetration, Soviet terror, or other instances of twentieth century mass violence and totalitarianism in contemporaries and descendants. Since understanding the past always serves requirements of the present, the boom prompts the question: why the interest in past complicities now?</p>
            <p>The comprehensive background of my reading is the hypothesis that the texts address convergences between involvements in past acts of mass violence and current forms of participation in wrongdoings of humanitarian, political, ecological, or other natures in neoliberalism. While these issues differ in many respects, they are related in structural and historical terms. Structurally, both present the challenge of forming a nuanced notion of participation, the idea and promise at the heart of democracy, digital media, and consumer capitalism that is highly valued yet poorly conceptualized. Historically, both issues are related since justifications of past involvements have established the terminology, narratives, and heuristics in which terror, repression, and acts of mass violence are subsequently discussed by inscribing them into cultural traditions, thus forming the frame for negotiating current problematic involvements. The convergence is, therefore, of particular interest in view of the global crisis of political participation, which is currently undermined by an often unwilling but inevitable participation in detrimental economic structures that can be linked to the ecological crisis, the delegitimization of democracy, and the retreat to identitarian ideologies, not least in &#x201c;memory wars.&#x201d;
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN2">2</xref>
                </sup> The modes of complicity stand out more clearly&#x2014;and are acknowledged more readily&#x2014;with reference to past violence. They are more complicated, but just as active, in the globalized world of the present.</p>
            <p>The segment of this wider context that will be discussed within the confines of this article pertains to the stance of the present outlook onto the past: some texts highlight distance from the violent past while others emphasize the onlookers&#x2019; involvement in an ongoing transmission of the aftermath of past violence. This duality arises from a profound ambivalence in the analogy between totalitarianisms and neoliberalism. Complicities in past totalitarianisms may be paralleled with current problematic involvements to find models for comprehending issues of the present in cultural memory and/or to understand the genealogy of forms of social interaction and their justification. This analytical approach is counteracted by hedonistic, or consoling, readings which evoke instances of past complicities to appease the sense that all is not quite well, even after the demise of Nazi and Soviet rule, by drawing attention to how bad, how much worse things have been, and grant distancing. This effect has been studied in German mass media representations of the Shoah, which, as Giesen points out, create a &#x201c;collective memory&#x201d; by way of &#x201c;identification with the past&#x201d; at the price of permitting to &#x201c;consume this disconnected past as exotic alterity and even as sentimental entertainment.&#x201d;
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN3">3</xref>
                </sup> Authorial intent cannot prevent such readings. Literature differs eminently from juridical discourse&#x2014;from which the term 
                <italic toggle="yes">complicity</italic> is borrowed&#x2014;in that authorial intent is not decisive for the reception of a text. What matters is the complex relation between identificatory options offered by the text and the readers&#x2019; various ways of adopting them. This relational openness is decisive especially in the genre of documentary fiction, to which most of the texts portraying historical complicities belong.</p>
            <p>Documentary fiction, i.e., texts portraying historical events in a fictitious plot or dialogue give accounts of acts of mass violence that evade conventional historiographic means, because of a lack of surviving victims who could testify as well as political and psychological resistance in perpetrators, accomplices, and descendants. Therefore, Madigan notes, &#x201c;literature often plays an outsized role in its ability to represent and broadcast trauma at the cultural level&#x201d;.
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN4">4</xref>
                </sup> While the conflation of fact and fiction is prone to raise ethical concerns,
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN5">5</xref>
                </sup> non-factual accounts are indispensable to shaping a collective memory of forms of violence that aim at exterminating groups of people and their cultural heritage.
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN6">6</xref>
                </sup> I speak of &#x201c;documentary&#x201d; rather than &#x201c;historical&#x201d; fiction because a pivotal concern of the texts is how documented historical facts are merged into both societal historical narratives and personal memory. The purpose of documentary fiction is neither to forge historical facts or even to convey facts, nor to form juridical decisions, but to confront audiences intellectually and emotionally with complex situations of ethically problematic involvement. Works of documentary fiction rely on the fact that all reading is based on participation, as texts speak to implicit readers, and that literature requires the participation of audiences, be it the voice and imagination of the reader or the gaze of the spectator. Fiction, moreover, depends on what Coleridge calls a &#x201c;willing suspension of disbelief&#x201d;.
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN7">7</xref>
                </sup> Documentary fiction relies on reader participation to reflect on instances of historical participation in mass violence. The point of this aesthetic reflection is neither to prove the readers&#x2019; distance from a &#x2018;tragic past&#x2019;, nor to rule out such readings, but to draw attention to exactly the issue of distance&#x2014;be it hedonistic or analytical. Both imply emotional distancing, while reading requires participation.</p>
            <p>In the following, I will juxtapose two literary texts in order to analyze two prominent alleys of distancing that constitute the very opposite: not distance, but a particular form of complicity with the transmission of discourses that justify or foster mass violence. These modes of distancing are relevant because they are no mere literary phenomenon but mirror elements of the wider socio-political debate on memory culture. Some texts reproduce these modes of distancing, others reflect on them. One mode is a spatio-temporal distancing of the commemorating point of view &#x2018;in the West&#x2019; from the portrayed violence in &#x2018;the East&#x2019;. It will by outlined by way of reading passages from Valerie Fritsch&#x2019;s 2020 novel 
                <italic toggle="yes">Herzklappen von Johnson &amp; Johnson</italic> (Heart Valves by Johnson &amp; Johnson). A second strategy, used particularly when spacial distancing is impossible, is moral distancing, i.e., to cast the narrator, and readers, as morally and/or intellectually superior to complicit characters. This strategy is discussed in Elfriede Jelinek&#x2019;s 2008 play 
                <italic toggle="yes">Rechnitz (Der W&#x00fc;rgeengel)</italic> (trans. Rechnitz [The Extermination Angel], 2015). To elucidate the convergence between past complicities and involvements in neoliberalism, I will, furthermore, refer to Maria Stepanova&#x2019;s 2017 essayistic novel 
                <italic toggle="yes">&#x041f;&#x0430;&#x043c;&#x044f;&#x0442;&#x0438; &#x043f;&#x0430;&#x043c;&#x044f;&#x0442;&#x0438;</italic> (In Memory of Memory, 2021), which I have discussed in detail elsewhere.

                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN8">8</xref>
                </sup> Outlining the two strategies of distancing from the violent past, however, first of all, requires a brief discussion of the concept of complicity because its complications in juridical discourse are what renders it productive in literary texts.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
            <title>Complicity in and beyond the Law</title>
            <p>As a legal term, complicity describes the way a crime is committed, namely by aiding or abetting wrongdoing. Yet complicity poses a challenge to the law as it undermines the principles of individual accountability and autonomous action: dependent on the actions of a principal wrongdoer, the accomplice is still autonomous insofar as aiding or tolerating wrongdoing makes a difference.
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN9">9</xref>
                </sup> Accountability is based on individual intentionality, which gives rise to a particular difficulty in current corporate and international law, whereby corporate and state complicity with human rights infringement and environmental damage often evades sanction, because corporations and states are not understood to have intentions. This, paradoxically, renders them actors without intent.
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN10">10</xref>
                </sup> Complicity thus marks the limits of legal discourse by pointing beyond the law&#x2019;s methodological individualism to structures of social relationality. This connectedness is exploited in the totalitarian strategy of reassuring the individual&#x2019;s sense of guilt while undermining individual action and personal accountability&#x2014;a process outlined in Arendt&#x2019;s maxim, &#x201c;Where all are guilty, nobody is&#x201d;.
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN11">11</xref>
                </sup> Declaring everyone guilty is tantamount to labelling wrongdoing inevitable and&#x2014;in ultimate analytical complicity&#x2014;to dropping the differentiation between moral choices, just as it had been aborted in totalitarianism. </p>

            <p>This issue is where literary discourse can make a decisive contribution. Assessments of historical involvement in wrongdoing rely on reconstructive narratives

                </sup> The structure of these narratives, however, the relation between fictional, documentary, and prescriptive legal speech is hardly reflected. Yet the medium of language is, in fact, a good model for approaching the complication of complicity, that is: individually responsible participation in a communal structure. Responsible individual speakers cannot but use preformed phonetic, semantic, and syntactic structures. The relational aspect of human action that poses a problem to legal thought is the focus of literary discourse, which foregrounds language as principal medium of human interaction. This is as true for the spoken word as for texts. In analyzing literary discourse, the notion of complicity is useful not because it provides clarity (it does not), but because it marks problematic participation, enmeshment, and degrees of responsibility that may evade straightforward legal culpability.

            <p>One such instance of problematic implication relates to the very concepts &#x201c;totalitarianism&#x201d; and &#x201c;neoliberalism.&#x201d; Both are highly politicized and often employed for polemical rather than analytical purposes. Just as complicity, the terms totalitarianism and neoliberalism are relevant for a discourse that reflects on the point of view of the commemorator as inscribed in conventions of cultural memory because they cast doubt on the claim to analytical distance. Totalitarianism is a historiographical concept to describe a particular form of power that controls all aspects of life by way of a mixture of utopianism, scientism, and political violence.

            <p>While this paper cannot do full justice to the debates on totalitarianism and neoliberalism, it seeks to highlight two discursive phenomena. Firstly, theoretical concepts participate in historical processes as much as they describe them. Concepts may be regarded as archives of cultural memory
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN27">27</xref>
                </sup> since their implications and incoherence testify to socio-political ruptures and consequent hermeneutical crises.
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN28">28</xref>
                </sup> Secondly, while such incoherence complicates exchange and fosters polemic, it is also what permits the accommodation of different voices and divergent positions in social interaction. This is to say that while the claim to analytical distance enables an important form of discourse, namely critique, theoretical language does not grant a position outside the discursive parameter of cultural memory but enables speakers to participate in discourse. A striking case in point is the analogy between totalitarianism and neoliberalism that has been drawn, for instance, in political science, to criticize the idea of a spontaneous market order as bearing totalitarian markings as it equals self-regulated economy with civilization.

                </sup> Zuboff criticizes the parallel as inappropriate for understanding digitalized &#x201c;surveillance capitalism&#x201d;, and cites the belated understanding of Nazi and Stalinist totalitarianism in 20th century contemporaries as &#x201c;vivid precedent for this kind of encounter with an unprecedented new species of power.&#x201d;

                </sup> While it is true that the concepts of totalitarianism and neoliberalism describe very different phenomena, paralleling them is, still, no fallacy but a conventional hermeneutic strategy of cultural memory: transferring testimonies of past experience to unprecedented purposes. Literary texts are a key medium of this transfer, particularly documentary fiction that negotiates the stance of the present onlooker towards past complicities in mass violence and totalitarianism.</p>
            <p>Common sense and neoliberal theory would certainly locate totalitarianism and neoliberalism on opposing ends of the political spectrum. This is doubtlessly true in terms of the ideas underlying these political orders, yet the polarity does not hold utterly true in terms of human relationality. I speak of a convergence between&#x2014;rather than a similarity of&#x2014;complicities with totalitarianisms and involvements in neoliberal wrongdoing to point out that while these orders are certainly different, individual experience in both shares in a problem. Narratives of complicity are, of course, no recent phenomenon,

                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN31">31</xref>
                </sup> yet the current popular fascination with the issue appears to be indicative of a particular modern urgency in thinking about willing and unwilling participation and shared agency. An important clue about the background of this fascination can be taken from Arendt, who writes about twentieth century totalitarianisms: </p>

            <p>That &#x201c;nonparticipation&#x201d; is &#x201c;a matter of decision&#x201d; holds true for the neoliberal present of globalized markets, conflicts, climate change, and digital media: the individual maybe conceptualized as free to decide not to participate in them, yet implementing this decision is hard, and often comes at the substantial prize of non-inclusion into key societal structures. More abstractly speaking, what makes complicity a ubiquitous phenomenon in (not only Western) Modernity might be the parallel of a far-reaching striving for civic participation of individuals in mass-based societies on the one hand, and the lack of sophisticated political concepts of participation outlining the relationality of the so-called Modern individual on the other. This is, yet again, where the relevance of literary texts to the broader societal discourse comes in. Because rather than insisting on analytical distance, as terminological language has to, literary texts can explore language as principal medium of human relationality and point out that insisting on distance from the problematic past involvement of others misses the seminal, albeit uncomfortable, affectedness of the observer that is the very basis for analysis and critique.</p>
            <p>Complicity, this brief exploration has shown, is an ambivalent charge as it is hardly functional within and too general outside a legalistic framework. Complicity can, however, be analytically productive if used not as a charge but as a marker for complexity. Analysing the role of intellectuals in South African apartheid, Sanders distinguishes &#x201c;acting-in-complicity,&#x201d; which can be legally and ethically judged, from an underlying &#x201c;responsibility-in-complicity,&#x201d; a connectedness with others that explains why even silence, non-listening, or inactivity may affect the lives of others.

            <p>Due to their peculiar possibility of merging fact and fiction, literary texts can address and counteract repression and denial in ways other discourses cannot. However, since literature is part of societal discourse, literary text just as often reproduce strategies of constructing a position of reading untouched by involvements. In portrayals of complicities with mass violence and totalitarianisms in Europe, a crucial mode of maintaining the non-involvement of the present observer is drawing a stark distinction between the present position of the author, and the reader, in the West via-&#x00e0;-vis the past violence as belonging to the East.</p>

Fritsch does not give any historical background, therefore, I do: in 1941, with the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, a ghetto was established in Drohobych, from where Jewish inhabitants of the town and the region were deported into concentration camps; the ghetto was dissolved in 1943, and the remaining prisoners were massacred in the nearby forest of Bronica.

                </sup> In Fritsch&#x2019;s text, however, the name of the place stands out just as traumatic experience remains unconnected to other, previous and later, experience.</p>
            <p>Fritsch&#x2019;s text has been met with great critical acclaim for its poetic qualities and portrayal of the transgenerational sequelae of perpetration.

                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN47">47</xref>
                </sup> This portrayal, however, is problematic since the text never reflects on the fact that the landscape traversed by the narrator is a geographical display of her heritage of silencing, emotional emptiness, and emphasis on non-involvement. Fritsch&#x2019;s ruined East is a soulscape, as it were, leaning on the Romanticist aesthetic insight that what renders an area a 
                <italic toggle="yes">landscape</italic> is that it mirrors the onlooker&#x2019;s emotions. Despite this pedigree, the nostalgic image of a ruined Eastern Europe is problematic because exoticist projection comes at a price, as has been pointed out with reference to other global instances. Looking at the East to find nothing but the ruined heritage of Nazi perpetration and denial forestalls any dialogue with people who inhabit this realm. Acting out the ancestors&#x2019; suppressed emotions and, as a consequence of this identification, reenacting their distancing from the violated realm, amounts to a complicity with past perpetration inasmuch as it maintains one-sidedness and transmits the point of view of perpetration.</p>
            <p>This is, of course, not to vouch for the anthropological accuracy of literature. Basis of my criticism is that as literary texts appeal to audience imagination by citing common assumptions (like Topol cites the expectation that nobody wants to be located in the East), literary texts carry a certain responsibility. What is crucial is how they 
                <italic toggle="yes">respond</italic> to the issues they address. This response is missing in Fritsch&#x2019;s text, which portrays the logic of the transgenerational transmission of the sequelae of mass violence perpetration neatly along the lines of what humanities and social sciences research has outlined, but aspires to no reflexion on, or aesthetic disruption of, its logic beyond the portrayal of unhappy self-absorption. And the pleasure of reading the text shares in the enterprise of remembering to forget&#x2014;in the sense that engaging with a &#x201c;&#x2019;comfortable horrible&#x2019; memory&#x201d;
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN48">48</xref>
                </sup> may reassure audiences of a responsible outlook while diverting attention from the ethical complications it entails. In this setting, engaging with the past turns into a form of consumerism that reduces the awareness of sequalae of terror and violence to symbolic capital, to a token of the commemorator&#x2019;s social responsibility. The content of this token is replaceable but not arbitrary, as concern for past violence stands in for the regard for current forms of political and institutional violence or economic injustices, which are more uneasy to engage with because observers may find themselves complicit with them.</p>
            <p>It has been argued that &#x201c;[t]he formation of neoliberalism and the rise of memory are two strictly contemporaneous phenomena,&#x201d; and that this is no coincidence: Unlike a grand r&#x00e9;cit of global progress and liberation, &#x201c;[f]ragmented and subjective memories do not challenge the existence of capitalism&#x201d;.

            <p>Fritsch&#x2019;s poetics of traumatic projection elucidates a further aspect of Macron&#x2019;s political projection of Europe all over the Asian part of Russia: both do not reckon with any agency positioned in the &#x2018;Eastern&#x2019; realm. Against the backdrop of Russia&#x2019;s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which ties in with the expansionist policy of &#x201c;Russian World&#x201d; (&#x0420;&#x0443;&#x0441;&#x0441;&#x043a;&#x0438;&#x0439; &#x043c;&#x0438;&#x0440;),

                </sup> it becomes clear that Putin may have agreed with Macron&#x2019;s 2019 expansionist outreach, uttered in the first-person plural, yet with a very different agenda in mind. Reducing &#x2018;the East&#x2019; to a canvas for traumatic projection or political projects from a point of view which understands itself, by contrast, as &#x2018;Western&#x2019;, precludes one from making encounters and thus renders unable to respond to current voices and crises. What is necessary to interrupt the projection is to face ambivalence, to acknowledge one&#x2019;s own destructiveness instead of locating all destruction in remote spaces and past times. This is prerequisite to encountering not solely a function of one&#x2019;s own psychic organization but to facing an actual counterpart, or adversary, and responding to them.</p>
            <p>Still, the traumatic projection in Fritsch&#x2019;s text is no mere lapse, but mirrors a structural problem. A critical response to the ongoing transmission of discourses that justify, foster, excuse, or deny mass violence is always necessary but particularly challenging with regard to Eastern Europe, as Stepanova&#x2019;s essayistic novel &#x041f;&#x0430;&#x043c;&#x044f;&#x0442;&#x0438; &#x043f;&#x0430;&#x043c;&#x044f;&#x0442;&#x0438; (In Memory of Memory) points out. The text portrays the difficulty of articulating a commemorative familial narrative of the author&#x2019;s Jewish Russian ancestors in the context of a largely repressed communal memory of Nazi and Soviet terror. 
                <italic toggle="yes">In Memory of Memory</italic> reports the process of reconstructing a family history based on an archive full of photographs, letters, and diaries discovered after the death of an aunt of the narrator. The text portrays the fate of family members in critical moments of Russian and European history and points out the many unknowns which accompany the known episodes of the past. What sets Stepanova&#x2019;s text apart from the large corpus of contemporary family history narratives is that it is conscious of how easily personal memory narratives tie in with legitimizing the neoliberal status quo by presenting a much more horrible past. Stepanova addresses this issue by reverting the common order of critical discourse as the literary text discusses theoretical concepts of memory studies which have been formed in reading literary texts, most notably the notion of &#x201c;postmemory&#x201d;.

                </sup> in traumatic memories can be regarded as one of the reasons for a renewed, and altered, interest in complicity with Nazi perpetration, Soviet terror, or other instances of twentieth century mass violence and totalitarianism in current literatures: generations who have not witnessed the past violence themselves approach it against the backdrop of their own involvements. However, in Central and Eastern European audiences, there is often a lack of a clear &#x201c;generational remove&#x201d;, as Stepanova suggests, so that complicities with political violence and involvement in neoliberal wrongdoing do, in fact, converge in individual experience. Stepanova&#x2019;s In 
                <italic toggle="yes">Memory of Memory</italic> challenges the Western bias of memory studies that the transgenerational transmission of trauma anachronistically imports psychosocial sequelae of past violence into a present that is profoundly different from that past.

Crucial for Stepanova&#x2019;s text is that the suite can only be seen from a point of view aligned with that axis, not from outside the alignment. Enfilades are part of feudal architectural grandeur. The notion of a &#x201c;traumatic enfilade&#x201d; suggests that starting with czarist despotism, the sequence of historical events in Russia and the Soviet Union in the ninetieth, twentieth and twenty-first centuries have created the point of view from where an observer cannot claim to look 
                <italic toggle="yes">back</italic> at a distanced past but speaks from within an ongoing transmission of terror and violence that requires critical reflection in order not to participate in the reproduction of sequelae of victimization, perpetration, and complicity.</p>
            <p>Stepanova&#x2019;s text folds analytical terminology back into the literary text because she doubts the two fundamental claims of conceptual language: distance and generalization. Insisting on analytical distance misses the seminal, albeit uncomfortable affectedness and involvement of the observer that is the very reason for analysis and criticism. Generalizing memorial structures found in Western Europe contributes to hiding this affectedness. From a non-Western point of view, understanding the transgenerational transmission of trauma and psychosocial sequelae of perpetration is necessary because the violence inducing them is not strictly past. This intervention does not run counter to the conceptual foundations of memory studies. Trauma, as well as discourses that justify terror and mass violence, undermine the commonsensical temporality of before, during, and after the fact&#x2014;the latter in that they often set the linguistic and heuristic frame for the subsequent moral and juridical evaluation of violence to the effect that they are not strictly past but last. A striking case in point is, as discussed above, the concept of &#x201c;totalitarianism&#x201d;, which had been seminal to the rhetoric of Fascism and National Socialism
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN59">59</xref>

            <p>There can be no doubt that mass violence deserves moral condemnation. What I call moral distancing (for the time being, for lack of a better term) is the strategy to secure the author&#x2019;s and the reader&#x2019;s non-involvement in the portrayed acts of mass violence and totalitarian terror by casting them as morally, and often also intellectually, superior to portrayed complicit characters. This moral high ground is problematic because is presumes that there is no ongoing transmission of discourses which justify, foster, excuse, or deny perpetration or complicity, which allows audiences to consume a supposedly disconnected, horrific past as exotic alterity. However, the very presumption of profound moral distance&#x2014;that &#x201c;it can&#x2019;t happen here&#x201d; or now&#x2014;is a seminal precondition for transmitting such discourses,

Most of the victims&#x2019; bodies have not been found to this day, and the known perpetrators have evaded prosecution. The 1994 documentary film

            <p>Jelinek&#x2019;s play references the documentary film as one of its sources but desists from giving a clear account of the massacre itself and thus responds drastically to the question of whether the representation of past violence should become a source of entertainment or consolation for the spectator. This issue is by no means detached from understanding historical massacring which is, as historian S&#x00e9;melin puts it, &#x201c;the most spectacular practice which those in power have at their disposal to assert their ascendancy&#x201d;.

For it is easy to dismiss the pictured gentleman as old Nazi, to feel morally and intellectually superior to him.

            <p>Pentheus wants to see, not in spite of, but because of being disgusted by the sight. Yet the intradiegetic exchange also pertains to the metadiegetic level, to the spectators of the play in the audience. They are far from uninvolved, distanced, &#x201c;sitting in silence under the firs&#x201d;. They are eminently implicated because their gaze, affectedness, and emotional response is the very purpose of the theatrical performance. Euripides highlights the voyeurism implicit in the stance of the spectator of a staged play, the lust of looking at violence from a supposed distance. Jelinek references Euripides&#x2019; tragedy among her sources and cites it in quotes and allusions, pointing out that literary genres comprise a reflection of the stance and participation of their audience. In referencing Euripides&#x2019; play, which emphasizes the complicity of the theater audience, Jelinek highlights that her documentary fiction on stage is not a genre of moral purification, but one of contamination. She desists from staging the massacre, and thus from turning the past violence into a source of present enjoyment, in order to draw attention to the audience&#x2019;s participation in violence&#x2014;a&#x2014;participation that Sigmund Freud sees inscribed in the staging of victimization: tragedy seems to provide spectators with the position of an uninvolved, distanced beholder but their gaze and pleasure&#x2014;the purpose of the spectacle&#x2014;makes them complicit in the violence.

            <p>This passage makes clear that the charge of complicity is no means for producing clarity. It&#x2019;s unsettling volatility that lends itself to very different agendas, rather, marks involvements that remain concealed in complacent ascriptions of perpetrator roles. The point of Jelinek&#x2019;s documentary play is thus not least the ambivalence of its genre: documentary fiction creates attention for the suffering of victims, for the issue of participatory violence, and of complicity in the transmission of justificatory discourses, by making the audience participate in this very complicity.</p>

        <body>
            <p>This article gives an overview of selected literary works that narrate instances of historical complicity in the Central East European contexts, and makes a series of original observations about the prevalence or a 'wave' of such literary representations in the 21st century European literature. The article anchors its detailed analyses of two literary texts in a theoretical and philosophic literature in memory and post-memory studies, trans-generational trauma theory, and testimonial theory (to mention just those). The concept of complicity is well outlined and the argument for the importance of literary accounts of complicity (by way of addressing structural and conceptual limitations of the juridical discourse on complicity) is persuasive. I have also enjoyed and learnt from the author's eloquent analyses of Jelinek's 
                <italic>Rechnitz </italic>and Fritsch's 
                <italic>Hertzklappen</italic>.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Hence, the problem with the article is not the content or its conceptualisation, but, rather, its framing as presented in the opening sections. In my view, the article promises to do something else than it actually does - the opening questions about the present-day cultural traction of literary representations of complicity and its purport to the contemporary reader are not answered. Rather, the analytic focus throughout is on the aesthetic strategies of distanciation, and how these overlap and imbricate with the politics and ethics of (self) separation from difficult history. The opening point about what the author calls 'convergence' &#x00a0;(between historical complicity and the complexities of participation in exploitative economic, social and economic structures today) thus disappears in the main section of the article. My suggestion would be to re-frame the article so that it starts off with articulating the problem that it actually addresses and persuasively argues - how selected works of literature replicate and implement aesthetics of patio-temporal and moral distanciation, and how other literary works subvert and resist them.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> I also wonder (though could be convinced otherwise) whether this arrangement of two primary analyses (Fritsch and Jelinek) isn't somewhat too binary and too oppositional - one text is clearly presented as replicating problematic aesthetics of distanciation and the other as subverting them. In this binary, the references to Stepanova's 
                <italic>In Memory of Memory</italic> are pushed to the periphery of the paper, but the author's insight is fascinating and left me wanting to read more. Perhaps it would be possible to give a more prominent place in the article to&#x00a0;Stepanova so that there is a detailed analysis of three literary works, and not two, and the author explored how the subversion or 'undoing' of the strategies of distanciation happens in Stepanova? It might be an issue of a word count to extend the paper in this way, but might be worthwhile to consider.&#x00a0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Finally, I also want to point to a number of places in the paper where interesting formulations are somewhat underdeveloped&#x00a0;and could benefit from more elaboration, or where turns of an argument are too abrupt: 
                <list list-type="bullet">
                    <list-item>
                        <p>The reference to the point on 'totalitarianism' on pp. 7 &amp; 8 comes and ends too abruptly; could it be folded more onto the analysis?</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>The reference to Bacchae, and its relevance for the author's analysis of Jelinek needs more development; it intrigues, but its significance is somewhat elusive.</p>
                    </list-item>
                </list> For the discussion of Arendt's point from 
                <italic>Responsibility and Judgment</italic>, see also Arendt's rather little-discussed short text "Answers to Questions Submitted by Samuel Grafton" (included in 
                <italic>The Jewish Writings</italic> collections ed. by Kohn and Feldman), where she develops the point on guilt and responsibility.

                <p>I thank all reviewers for their detailed reading od my paper, their encouraging words, and their very useful criticism that was critical to improving the argument!</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> I have addressed all concerns, which means, in detail: The most important point of criticism shared by all reviewers was a certain gap between the lead hypothesis on convergences between complicities in totalitarianism and involvement in neoliberalism on the one hand, and the focus on distancing on the other hand. I have addressed this absolutely right observation by:

                        <list-item>
                            <p>Added a substantial segment to the part &#x201c;Complicity in and beyond the Law&#x201d; explaining how the broader frame and the question of distance correlate, and I come back to it in paragraphs added to the readings of Fritsch and Jelinek.</p>

                    </list> 
            </p>
                <p> Further, smaller points have been addressed as follows:

                        <list-item>
                            <p>I have expanded the signposting explaining why I juxtapose Fritsch&#x2019;s and Jelinek&#x2019;s text, and I have added a note to my detailed discussion of Stepanova elsewhere (which is the reason why I did not expand it is this paper).</p>
                        </list-item>
                        <list-item>
                            <p>I have, as noted in the general point, substantially expanded the discussion of totalitarianism. I have expanded the explanation of the reference to Bacchae to explain how it relates to the issue of complicity and distance.</p>

                        <list-item>
                            <p>I am also thankful for making me aware of Arendt&#x2019;s text of her Eichmann book. However, I have not included it because a) the discussion of guilt and responsibility of Eichmann refers to an individual rather than the relational aspect I want to focus on, and b) the tremendously difficult question of the Judenr&#x00e4;te discussed in Arendt would require a detailed discussion that would go beyond the scope of my article. But I will certainly come back to the text in my further work.</p>

        <body>
            <p>This article explores the reflection on complicity in terror and perpetration across Eastern and Central European literatures. It is highly original in its operationalisation of complicity, which is first and foremost presented as a legal concept, in a narratological context. The analysis is particularly convincing where it demonstrates how literary narratives can involve readers, but also offer ways of distancing them from the perpetration that the texts refer to. Examples like Valerie Fritsch' 
                <italic>Herzklappen von Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x00a0;</italic>or Eva Menasse's 
                <italic>Dunkelblum</italic>&#x00a0;demonstrate how narrative strategies of spatial, temporal and moral distancing create an effect of reassuring consolation for the reader, where a text addresses collective complicity in atrocities committed within totalitarian rule. Finally, the author shows how Elfriede Jelinek's&#x00a0;
                <italic>Rechnitz (Der W&#x00fc;rgeengel)&#x00a0;</italic>consciously avoids such consolation as it exposes how readers / the audience themselves become complicit when they voyeuristically enjoy the narrative engagement with atrocities of the past.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Similar to the first peer reviewer, I believe that the article is convincing in its main points, but the argument about the reasons for the current rise in interest about atrocities during Nazi and Soviet rule needs to be rethought. It features prominently in the abstract, the introduction and the conclusion, but is not sufficiently addressed in the main part of the article. Generally, the text is quite ambitious despite it being a relatively short essay of roughly 5000 words. While the general concept is strong, some of the examples for distancing effects are only presented very briefly and a more extensive discussion of the literary texts the author refers to would help to carve out these ideas more clearly.</p>

            <p>The article inquires into the functions of contemporary documentary fictions that engage with the horrors of the Third Reich and Soviet Union. By drawing on a legal category, complicity, the author offers a highly original approach to evaluating ethical attitudes implicit in documentary fiction. While the concept occupies a marginal position in legal discourse, complicity becomes analytically fertile when applied to the realm of fictional settings that shape the collective memory.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The author&#x2019;s case examples include Jachym Topol&#x2019;s 
                <italic>The Devil&#x2019;s Workshop</italic>, Valerie Fritsch&#x2019;s 
                <italic>Herzklappen von Johnson &amp; Johnson</italic>, Maria Stepanova&#x2019;s 
                <italic>In Memory of Memory</italic> and Elfriede Jelinek&#x2019;s 
                <italic>Rechnitz</italic>, the main focus being placed on Fritsch and Jelinek. Accordingly, Fritsch&#x2019;s text, irrespective of its poetic qualities, exemplifies an ethical stance that problematically continues the aggressor&#x2019;s perspective. During the narrator&#x2019;s journeys through Eastern Europe, its territories remain faceless places deprived of socio-political agency. The author&#x2019;s strong criticism of Fritsch is supported by enlightening references to Stepanova. One can only agree with the author&#x2019;s argument. The text&#x2019;s narrator keeps a safe distance from the events of the past, a stance that is afforded by the elision of the East&#x2019;s agency and present-day reality.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> By way of contrast, the author singles out Jelinek&#x2019;s play as a glowing example of a more truthful engagement with the past. In her account of the Rechnitz massacre, justificatory discourses take centre stage. Rhetoric cliches are not only instrumental in deflecting guilt, but are intrinsically linked to a questionable aesthetics of dramatic jouissance, originating in Greek antiquity. While the reviewer does not agree with the author&#x2019;s idea that Jelinek&#x2019;s drama lacks a self-righteous &#x201c;moral high ground&#x201d;, this benevolent assessment is well-accepted in academe and does not need any further explanation.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The only reservation concerns an idea that is, although prominent in the abstract, only faintly sketched in the main argument: the hypothesis &#x201c;that the texts address convergences between involvements in past acts of mass violence and current forms of participation in wrongdoings in neoliberalism&#x201d; (p. 1). In this argument, the distinctions between totalitarianism and neoliberalism are flattened through a sweeping generalisation: Since both forms of government require the individual's complicity in oppression, argues the author, totalitarian and neoliberal modernity must be considered continuities. (The critical reference to this notion is Dupuy 2016.) Even in Neomarxist thought, this makes for an unusual argument, as it goes against basic assumptions in political science. In fact, classic liberalists like Hayek regard the welfare state as more closely linked to totalitarianism than neoliberalism. (See Thomas Biebricher, 
                <italic>The Political Theory of Neoliberalism</italic>, Stanford: Stanford UP, 2018, pp. 18&#x2013;21.) While nothing speaks against expanding on this provocative statement, it would require substantial discussion. This argument is not central to the paper. For the sake of clarity, the author should either elaborate on this argument or remove it.</p>

            <p> </p>
            <p> P. 7: &#x201c;Marcon&#x201d; &gt; &#x201c;Macron&#x201d; (7).</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> P. 9: Although the author is undoubtedly aware of the etymology of &#x201c;Holy See&#x201d;, the text suggests that the term is related to &#x201c;seeing&#x201d; (Engl.) rather than &#x201c;sedes&#x201d; (Latin).</p>

                <p>I thank all reviewers for their detailed reading of my paper, their encouraging words, and their very useful criticism that was critical to improving the argument!</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> I have addressed all concerns, which means, in detail: The most important point of criticism shared by all reviewers was a certain gap between the lead hypothesis on convergences between complicities in totalitarianism and involvement in neoliberalism on the one hand, and the focus on distancing on the other hand. I have addressed this absolutely right observation by:

                            <p>Improving the framing so as to differentiate the comprehensive background of my reading from the element of that background that can actually be addressed in a paper (see Introduction).</p>

                        <list-item>
                            <p>Added a substantial segment to the part &#x201c;Complicity in and beyond the Law&#x201d; explaining how the broader frame and the question of distance correlate, and I come back to it in paragraphs added to the readings of Fritsch and Jelinek.</p>

                        <list-item>
                            <p>I thank Johannes Kaminski for making me aware of Biebricher&#x2019;s study on the history of neoliberalism and his argument, which I also included.</p>
                        </list-item>
                    </list> I have also corrected the typos; I am very thankful they have been brought to my attention!</p>
