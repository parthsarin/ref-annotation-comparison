                <p>We would like to share data from a survey run by the Young Academy of Europe (YAE) from June to October 2020, with questions aiming to unravel the situation of early-career researchers (including early stage group leaders) working in Europe, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We were particularly interested in the impact of career activities (related to young children or other family members), and the impact of gender. We include the online survey and collected data, without identifying information. The survey is published in

                <title>The survey</title>
                <p>A total of 33 questions were designed and uploaded onto the SoGoSurvey platform (
                    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sogosurvey.com/">www.sogosurvey.com</ext-link>). The survey was quite detailed and contained three sections: working conditions (15 questions); personal background (13 questions); and optional questions (4 questions). The survey was a mix of multiple choice and short answer questions. It was tested with volunteers (board members of the YAE and members of the Hungarian Young Academy) for clarity before use. No changes were made after preliminary testing. As we are not experts in the field, we discussed the survey with experts during its development (see Acknowledgements).</p>

                <title>Data collection</title>
                <p>A link to the survey was shared via Young Academy of Europe (YAE) website (
                    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://yacadeuro.org/">https://yacadeuro.org/</ext-link>), newsletter, social media channels, and YAE contact channels (primarily other Young Academies, e.g. the Hungarian Young Academy and its Facebook page, where it was posted more than one time). We estimate our reach was between 1300-1500 people. We required that the respondent worked in research in academia in Europe at the time of the survey. Note that since we focused on Young Academies, this means that our participants were not completely random; most Young Academies tend to be quite selective in admission, but the selection criteria can vary by Academy. The survey results indicate whether or not a respondent was a member of a Young Academy.</p>
                <p>At the end of the survey, participants were asked to provide informed consent. Information about the YAE Privacy Policy was included as well. The survey ran from June to October 2020.</p>
                <p>Collected responses were then collated using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2019).</p>

                <p>Participants were asked to confirm consent at the end of the survey by ticking a &#x2018;Certificate of Consent&#x2019; box.</p>
                <p>No further ethical approval was sought, as this is deemed a low-risk study. Identifying information, such as names or institution names (where provided), have been removed from the shared data in order to maintain anonymity.</p>

            <p>This is a survey used by the authors to publish an article in the 
                <italic>Nature </italic>career column. The dataset includes a large number of questions that are designed to advance our understanding of how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected early-career researchers in Europe. The sample size is large enough for statistical analysis, and the questions utilized in the dataset are sound. On the other hand, the low response rates reported by the authors, as well as the study's exclusive focus on 'young academies', necessitate the use of caution when interpreting the results from the study. Despite these relatively minor weaknesses, however, the dataset will surely contribute to our understanding of the pandemic and its consequences for academics.</p>
            <p>Are sufficient details of methods and materials provided to allow replication by others?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Is the rationale for creating the dataset(s) clearly described?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Are the datasets clearly presented in a useable and accessible format?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Are the protocols appropriate and is the work technically sound?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>

            <p>The data note title: Data survey on the impact of the pandemic on early-stage academics is a timely contribution which sheds light on the early career researchers (ECR) who are in a precarious situation in the neoliberal academic arena. ECRs are in a vulnerable position, they are in a period of life when they are starting a family, while they are expected to put a considerable amount of effort in their academic career, in order to stay on the demanding scientific track. Most of the ECRs (this is especially true for women) are struggling with finishing their PhDs while having small kids, or they are postponing motherhood in order to finish their PhDs. The pandemic put a lot of stress on ECRs, especially young academic mothers and the consequences of the pandemic on female ECRs are yet to be disclosed and analysed. Thus, the research presented through this data note is of great importance, as we need to raise awareness on ECRs and introduce various measures which will alleviate their career hurdles.</p>

            <p>Is the rationale for creating the dataset(s) clearly described?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
