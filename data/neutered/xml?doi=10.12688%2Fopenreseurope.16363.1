                <p>Agroecology largely focusses on terrestrial agroecosystems, but it can also be applied to fish farming. Indeed, ponds are typically used for fish production in Europe, but are also important reservoirs of biodiversity. Numerous studies demonstrate that both fish production and biodiversity are strongly determined by human management. One key practice in extensive fish farming, although more rare in Europe, is to dry out ponds. They are left dry for a complete year after several years of fish production. However, the extent to which this practice affects the functioning of the ecosystem, its biodiversity and fish production, remains unclear.</p>
                <p>We investigated data from 85 fish ponds in the Dombes region, France, sampled between 2007 and 2014. We related variation in key abiotic characteristics to the time since last dry-out. The dataset included organic matter content in pond sediments and concentrations of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus in the water column, and biotic components such as macrophytes cover and richness, phytoplankton concentration and richness, macroinvertebrates density, and fish yield.</p>
                <p>Our results show that drying out facilitates the mineralization of organic matter in sediments and results in higher concentrations of inorganic nitrogen in the water column. Macrophytes cover is highest during the first year after drying out, and gradually declines after at the expense of increasing phytoplankton concentration. The diversity of both is highest in the first year after drying out and declines rapidly, especially for macrophytes. Fish yield is at its maximum in the second year.</p>
                <p>Drying out fish ponds appears to be an important agroecological practice in extensive fish farming with an application every three to four years. Through nutrient recycling, this practice has a positive impact on the balance between primary producers and indirectly on the whole food web for two years. It optimizes fish production and allows biodiversity conservation.</p>

            <p>Agricultural landscapes in Europe are considered as important habitats for biodiversity conservation in anthropogenic areas (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-21">Eriksson, 2021</xref>;

                    <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). They are therefore increasingly targeted by nature protection policies that aim to maintain or increase biodiversity. For this purpose, multiple areas in Europe have been classified as Natura 2000 regions or as High Nature Value (HNV) areas (

                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-35">Mueller &amp; Maes, 2015</xref>). Agricultural landscapes are typically subjected to human interference to promote agricultural production and their ecological status strongly relies on specific practices (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-51">Schmitzberger 
                    <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).</p>
            <p>Several agricultural landscapes Europe are characterized by the occurrence of a high density of man-made ponds that have historically been used for extensive fish farming. Examples of such pond landscapes, also called &#x201c;pondscapes&#x201d;, are Midden-Limburg in Belgium, Trebon in the Czech Republic, Lausitz, Aischgrund and Oberpfalz in Germany, Waldviertel in Austria, but also Dombes, Lorraine, Brenne and Forez in France (

                    <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Many fish ponds have a rich history as they have often been created by monastic communities in the Middle Ages, in an effort to drain swampy areas (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-10">Avocat, 1975</xref>; Guichenon, 1650 cited in 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-48">Sceau, 1980</xref>), to ensure agricultural production, to reduce diseases, and to promote the production of freshwater fishes (Guichenon, 1650 cited in 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-48">Sceau, 1980</xref>). Today, extensive fish production is still an important agricultural practice in most of these regions. Pond management practices, including water management, pond fertilisation or liming, and fish stocking can vary strongly between regions and countries (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-30">Horv&#x00e0;th 
                    <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). However, the overall activities largely target the production of cyprinid fish species, such as common carp (
                <italic toggle="yes">Cyprinus carpio</italic>) for human consumption and restocking programs (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-30">Horv&#x00e0;th 
                    <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2002</xref>).</p>
            <p>All these ponds collectively contain more species and more rare species than other aquatic environments (

                    <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). These agroecosystems are of human origin and thus artificial environments (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-10">Avocat, 1975</xref>; Guichenon, 1650 cited in 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-48">Sceau, 1980</xref>). The biodiversity present in these agroecosystems is also the result of historical practices applied (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-55">Vallod &amp; Wezel, 2010</xref>). It would appear that unmanaged ponds are not conducive to biodiversity (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-47">Sayer 
                    <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2012</xref>)</p>
            <p>Fish pond managers are therefore increasingly challenged to combine economically profitable fish farming activities with maintaining proper ecological ecosystem functioning and high levels of biodiversity in these agroecosystems. In these &#x2018;pondscapes&#x2019;, fish farmers play an important role in biodiversity conservation by maintaining ponds or by organizing water circulation in the pond networks. In this regard, they are dealing with agroecology applied to extensive fish farming. Agroecology is based on 13 principles (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-29">HLPE, 2019</xref>; 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-62">Wezel 
                    <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2020</xref>), some of which are applicable to aquaculture and fish pond agroecosystems management. According to 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-9">Aubin 
                    <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. (2017)</xref>, agroecological fish pond systems can be defined with the following five principles: It should be (1) productive, (2) resilient and robust, (3) efficient in the use of local resources, but also (4) environmentally friendly, and (5) have a natural and cultural value. Here we find together the notions of production, conservation of biodiversity, and ecological status of systems. Indeed, biological interactions and ecosystem synergies build a complex trophic web, which allow fish production. However, the literature on agroecological practices applied to pond fish farming remains limited.</p>
            <p>A key management action in fish ponds is regular periodic drainage of ponds to harvest fish (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-30">Horvath

In addition to these short dry periods, in Dombes, ponds are empty every 4 or 5 years during a whole production season, approximately from March to September. It is an ancestral practice, called dry out in this paper, applied regularly and in some other fish pond systems (

                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-33">Lierdeman, 2013</xref>). Of all the extensive fish farming practices, drying out is the most common applied in the Dombes region. It is also a practice that brings together the most different ecological functions related to different agroecological principles (

                    <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). It is directly related to the third principle: using natural and local resources efficiently. However, it appears at the same time to be the practice restoring a high productivity level after water refilling. It allows the recycling of sediment material that accumulates during the production cycle to increase the concentration of mineral nutrients in the water for primary producers (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-9">Aubin 
                    <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-33">Lierdeman, 2013</xref>). It should also allow for macrophytes re-establishment and control of algal blooms (

                    <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). As in temporary ponds, this voluntary dry period also promotes a very specific flora, especially macrophytes with a short life cycle (

                    <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2023</xref>).</p>
            <p>Drying out a pond for one year affects both the physico-chemistry of the sediments and water but also the balance between primary producers and other biodiversity components such as macroinvertebrates. Theoretically, after the drying out, the aquatic plant community is composed of ruderal, fast-growing species, which allow the rapid recolonization of the environment. In subsequent years, the nutrient concentrations and the degree of pond eutrophication gradually increase. Ruderal plant species will be replaced by more competitive species (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-37">Oertli &amp; Frossard, 2013</xref>), and the ponds will subsequently switch into a turbid water state with low plant coverage and a dominance of phytoplankton in the water column. Earlier investigations show that such change in ecosystem state results in lower fish biomass production (

            <p>The present study therefore aimed to fill this important knowledge gap. More specifically, we aimed to analyse how a periodic one-year dry-out impacts the physico-chemical pond characteristics, the biomass and diversity of primary producers, invertebrate density and net fish yield. We hypothesized that (i) the dry-out enhances the mineralisation of organic matter accumulated in pond sediments and increases mineral nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations after water refilling, (ii) this mineral nutrient enrichment increases overall primary producers after the dry period, with a dominance of macrophytes over phytoplankton, and (iii) the diversity of macrophytes and benthic invertebrates&#x2019; densities are higher during the first year after the dry period and decreases over years in favour of a higher diversity and density of algae. Finally, (iv) drying out was expected to increase fish production with the highest net fish yield in the first year after drying out.</p>

                <p>The fishponds studied were located in the Dombes area, in the department of Ain, Northeast of Lyon, in a Natura 2000 region. This area is one of the main fish pond landscapes of France, comprising approximately 1,100 ponds and a total water surface of about 11,500 ha (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-11">Bernard &amp; Lebreton, 2007</xref>). These ponds also date back to the Middle Ages and have been used for extensive fish farming since then. They are organized in chains, with hydrological connectivity between ponds, according to annual draining for fish harvest. Historically, a mixture of common carp (

                        <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Ponds are drained annually during the cold season (autumn and winter) to harvest the fish and are immediately refilled with water, in early spring. This fish production cycle typically lasts for four to five years, after which the ponds are left dry for an entire full growth season. Average yield reaches 250 kg/ha (

After centrifugation, readings of absorbance were taken using a Shimadzu UV/VIS spectrophotometer UV-2101 (Schimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) at wavelengths of 630, 645, 663 and 750 nm. The CHL concentration was calculated based on the formula of

                <p>In addition to this quantitative information, water samples also allowed to assess the phytoplankton community composition. The water was stored in a one-litre bottle and fixed with Lugol. Specimen identification was done to genus level in the laboratory using the Uterm&#x00f6;hl method (

                <p>The macrophyte community composition was assessed once in each pond during the growth season (between end June and July) by identification of specimens within multiple quadrats (4 m&#x00b2;) that were distributed every 50 meters along five transects following the protocol described in

Transects were arranged perpendicularly to the pond&#x2019;s dam, the deepest part with the outlet, of each pond. Two transects were located in the periphery, along the belt of helophytes, one in the center of the pond and the last two at half distance between the laterals and the central one. The number of quadrats was therefore related to the size of the pond. Macrophytes were identified to species level to obtain the richness per pond and their abundance within each quadrant was scored with the cover-abundance estimates of

                <title>Benthic invertebrates</title>
                <p>Benthic invertebrates were sampled once in September in each pond every year. The protocol was based on the AFNOR NF T90-391 standard (

                <p>In the same way as mentioned above, the sediments were collected using an Eckman grab. Two samples were taken in an area of maximum depth reachable by foot and two others in shallower depth. These four samples allowed the equivalent of 0.1 m
                    <sup>2</sup> of sediment to be collected. Each point had to be at least 10 m away from the others. They were carried out in the sector of the outlet without getting too close to it in order to be representative of the environmental conditions. These samples were pooled to form more than one sample for analysis.</p>
                <p>The samples were first filtered in the field using a 0.315 mm sieve and the residue was then fixed with 5% formalin. This sample was then processed in the laboratory to determine the density of oligochaetes, corresponding to a number of individuals per area. It was measured using the formula: 3.log(1+(100.EFF)) where 100.EFF is the number of individuals per area per 0.1 m

                <p>For macrophytes richness, we used the Jackknife index based on 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-57">Vanacker (2016)</xref>. It allows to obtain a better estimation of the richness, often underestimated in fish ponds. Vanacker showed that it was the most suitable index for these environments and their biodiversity (

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-52">Soukainen and Cardoso (2022)</xref>. The Jackknife index appears to be the most accurate, efficient and least biased of the non-parametric indices for estimating species richness (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-57">Vanacker, 2016</xref>). It is calculated based on the number of species returned once and the number of quadrats made.</p>
                <p>The values of water parameters used were the medians of the various measurements taken during the year (April to July), to have a better representation, as the mean is more driven by extreme values.</p>
                <p>Firstly, to observe the variations of the different variables studied over the years since the last drying out, we created boxplots using functions from the ggplot2 package (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-64">Wickham, 2016</xref>).</p>
                <p>We used Levene tests to compare the variability of the variables between ponds monitored several years and ponds monitored only once. No significant differences were found. These results are in line with those highlighted by

                        <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. (2016)</xref>. One reason for this is that the ponds are emptied every year. But to take repetitions of some fish ponds into account, we also performed linear mixed models with the glmer function of the lme4 package (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-81">Bates, 2010</xref>). Depending on the variables, we used Poisson, negative binomial or Gaussian laws. The models used and their p-values are shown alongside the boxplots. This makes it possible to show if there is an effect of the practice of drying out on the variables studied.</p>
                <p>The models are in the form of (DryOut represents the year after the last drying out and PondID the identifier of each pond to take into account repetitions):</p>

The trajectory is mainly observed on the first dimension of the analysis, starting from the positive part of the X-axis (in the right part) with Y1 and going to the negative part (in the left) with Y4. Ponds that have been in water for 5 years or more are more located towards the center of the plot. In terms of variables, this trajectory corresponds to a shift from an agroecosystem dominated by macrophytes to one dominated by algae. A progressive increase in invertebrate density with the sawtooth evolution can be also observed as before in the analysis. The positioning of the ponds with water for more than 5 years shows a decrease of the primary productivity as a whole, with less good fish yields.</p>
                <p>In an addition analysis where Y&gt;5 ponds are separated for the respective exact years, we see the same results for the first four years classes. The fifth year seems to follow a similar logic with still good invertebrate densities but, the end of this evolution occurs with the sixth year, where the primary production decreases in an overall way. The positioning of the following years seems more random, with a logic more difficult to define and explain.</p>

                <title>Accumulation of organic matter and mineral nutrients in fish ponds</title>
                <p>The accumulation of organic matter in the bottom of the pond is a natural process in all standing water bodies, called sedimentation (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-37">Oertli &amp; Frossard, 2013</xref>). In the context of the Dombes fish ponds, we analysed the concentration of organic matter in the sediments according to the years after the last dry-out of the ponds. We expected an increase in organic matter content over the years; however, our results based on means for each year after drying did not support this, and thus did not confirming our hypothesis. The organic matter content in the sediments remained relatively stable for all the years studied, and no significant differences could be found. The fish farming practice based on emptying the pond every year in order to harvest fish in a small remaining part of the pond may explain these observations. During this, the more labile parts of the sediments can be washed away from the pond with the water drainage at the pond outlet. 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-54">Vallod and Sarrazin (2010)</xref> showed that for a 24-ha pond, 8.5 t of material were exported during emptying. Moreover, the period during draining when the sediments in the largest part of the ponds remain in contact with air, even if it is much shorter than during a one-year dry period, probably already allows a partial mineralisation of the organic matter that has accumulated, if the temperatures and oxygen concentrations are favourable for microbial activity (

                <p>Our results show higher concentrations of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus in the water after the dry-out years Y1 and Y2. Despite this, we did not observe any accumulation of organic matter in the sediments. We can nevertheless make the hypothesis that the drying up favours an incomplete mineralization of the organic matter in the sediments. Draining of the ponds increases the oxygen concentration in the sediments and thus promote the decomposition of organic matter (

                        <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). In the following years, we observed a progressive decrease, which likely resulted from a gradual increase in water turbidity caused by enhanced concentrations of phytoplankton. After the drying period, a first stage appeared during Y1 with a domination of macrophytes and a progressive shift between primary producers in Y2 and Y3. In Y4 and Y&gt;5, we noted the domination of phytoplankton and a collapse of macrophyte cover and richness, thus validating our initial hypothesis. However, if we look at the following years included in Y&gt;5, the concentration of both primary producers decreased thus reaching a third stage where the two primary producers were in low biomass quantity. This would suggest a decrease of the total primary production. Finally, after a dominance of macrophytes in Y1 and a progressive shift (Y2 and Y3) towards phytoplankton dominance (Y4), ponds could evolve to a detrital state based on decomposers (

                <p>In fish ponds, we would ideally maintain a continuous balance between these two primary producers in order to ensure a good productivity of the agroecosystem. This could correspond to an unstable state, between the two stable states defined by 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-49">Scheffer and Carpenter (2003)</xref>. Our results confirm that this situation of a balance between macrophytes and phytoplankton is mostly observed in Y2, but changes afterwards. Therefore, this balance is of interest for fish production systems to ensure a high productivity in the food web. In addition, the presence of a balance between both primary producers ensures that linked biodiversity is maintained. In our study, during Y2, macrophyte coverage averaged 40% of the pond surface and CHL concentration was around 53 &#x00b5;g/L. Regarding macrophytes, our results are higher than those recommended by

                        <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. (2023)</xref> highlighted about fifteen species specific to Y1. These are species with a high recolonization capacity or that are more tolerant to disturbance. Some species need this alternation between a dry phase and a wet phase. We found rare species, disappearing the following years. For the others years after drying-out, they observed the phenomenon of nestedness based on a loss of several species but not on a complete turnover (

                <p>Related to richness of phytoplankton taxa and CHL concentration, we found a negative correlation. These results are consistent with those found by 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-42">Qin 
                        <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. (2013)</xref>, showing that eutrophication decreases phytoplankton diversity. Phytoplankton richness was, like macrophytes, at its maximum during Y1 and then comparatively low in Y&gt;5 ponds. We also observed that when the concentration of CHL increased, the percentage of cyanobacteria also increased to the detriment of other types of algae, resulting in an overall loss of phytoplankton taxa diversity. It is known that when phytoplankton concentration increases during eutrophication, the biomass of cyanobacteria increases and leads to changes in taxonomic structure (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-28">Havens, 2008</xref>). Our results are therefore similar. This proliferation of cyanobacteria should be avoided because it leads to both a loss of biodiversity and a significant decrease in oxygen in the water. This anoxia can lead in some cases to strong fish losses.</p>
                <p>For invertebrates, the density was not at its maximum in Y1 but in Y2 and Y4. The recolonization time of these taxa appears to be longer after the disturbance of dry-out. Here we have only quantitative information with the density of invertebrates but not on the diversity present. Few studies have addressed the effect of drying out a pond on aquatic invertebrates.

The management practices included the removal of some of the sediments and trees growing around the pond. They can be compared to a dry-out with the objective of rejuvenating the agroecosystem. The duration of the dry period also appears to be an important factor in the ability to recolonize.

                <title>Drying out a pond as an important agroecological practice in extensive fish farming</title>
                <p>Drying out ponds allows a mineralisation process, which ensures a greater availability of nutrients in the water during Y1. This allows a good development and a balance between the primary producers. This practice also promotes higher levels of macrophyte richness in the ponds and a higher density of invertebrates, a major source of food for the fish, especially in Y2. All these elements explain the better fish yields observed, especially in the second year of production. They also validate the hypothesis that drying out ponds appears as an important agroecological practice in extensive fish farming.</p>
                <p>Our results are in line with some other research such as

                        <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. (2002)</xref> who also confirmed the beneficial role of a period of drying out. We can see that, in addition to fish production, it is the entire functioning of the agroecosystem, based on primary production but also some species or taxa diversity, that benefits from this practice, in certain periods after the pond drying out. The cycle of different states, water and sediment quality, fish yield, and elements of biodiversity is illustrated in 
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>. The drying out of ponds promotes a higher productivity of the agroecosystem during two or three years. The organic matter in the sediments undergoes mineralization during the dry period, making nitrate and phosphate available in the water the following years for primary production and thus also provides resources for fish. This enhanced mineralization can also limit the use of inputs during the fish production cycle. The disturbance through drying out and the available nutrients thereafter seem to support the recolonisation of macrophytes. Indeed, in Y2, a good state of equilibrium between the two types of primary producers is observed, but also macroinvertebrates in higher densities, altogether allowing better fish yields (
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). These observations are directly linked to one of the principles of agroecological fish pond management: &#x201c;an agroecological fish pond is robust and resilient&#x201d; (

                        <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Moreover, drying out allows also to reach higher levels of aquatic plant and algal diversity, at least in the first few years. These refer also to the other principles such as being environmentally friendly (principle 4), and having a natural and cultural value (5). The drying out also indicates a certain resilience and robustness of the ecosystem (2), which is however mostly pronounced in Y1 and Y2.</p>

                <p>Our results might also justify the will of local actors in the study area to join the RAMSAR convention on wetlands of international importance, which rewards sites and actors who want to preserve wetlands. The role of fish farmers applying the production in an agroecological way is of first importance to meet the objectives of biodiversity conservation. In typical European pondscapes where fish production remains, maintaining this activity is essential for pond subsistence.</p>

                <p>All the variables studied do not react in the same way to the disturbance caused by drying out ponds and do not evolve in the same way in the following years. Therefore, the question of the best dry-out frequency is important for the management of ponds from a production, but also ecological perspective.

(2016)</xref> on determining tipping points in fish pond systems, who highlighted a significant decline in their performance indicator after Y&gt;5. This indicator was based on aquatic plant richness, CHL, and fish yield. They stated that ideally, a pond should have more than 15 species of macrophytes, a CHL concentration below 60 &#x00b5;g/L &#x2013; tthe threshold above which tipping points of different environmental variables are observed &#x2013; and may assure a fish yield above 213 kg/ha. Our results show that we had a richness of macrophytes below 15 from four years onwards. The tipping point of 60 &#x00b5;g/L of CHL was not reached, but was very close during Y4. Finally, a fish yield of 213 kg/ha was only reached in the second year, but was lower in all other years. These median values were very close to the averages stated in the 2021 report of the local fish promotion association.</p>
                <p>Our results suggest that ponds should be dried out every three years. Indeed, ecosystem productivity, biodiversity levels and fish yields were at their maximum in the second year and then declined. Drying out at the end of the third year would allow a rapid return to these more favourable levels. Historically, the cycle has been of five or six years. Reducing it to four years would also have repercussions on water distribution. Indeed, each year a quarter of the ponds would be dry, instead of the current one-fifth. In a context of climate change and water shortage, this could be a solution for a better filling of the ponds.</p>
                <p>Only very few ponds in our study area are kept in water for more than five years. It would be interesting to analyse the effects of this practice in other fish farming regions. Indeed, effects may differ between such a drying out practice done for the first time and conducted historically, as water and biodiversity variables might potentially vary considerably as disturbance regimes are different. Another important point to emphasize concerns the variability observed on all the parameters studied in this paper. Indeed, even if the practice of drying out ponds, for an entire growth season, is a factor explaining interannual variability, the latter was highly significant in each class. It would be interesting to investigate which factors explain this variability.</p>

            <title>Conclusions</title>
            <p>Fish ponds face a double challenge: to produce fish to ensure a sufficient income for pond managers while conserving biodiversity. Indeed, some pondscapes are considered as sites for biodiversity conservation such as a Natura 2000 zones or Ramsar sites, as discussed in the study area by local and regional stakeholders for the past few years. Agroecological practices must reconcile the two, through supporting an optimized functioning of the agroecosystem. Among all these practices, drying out ponds, although a major disturbance, allow a good functioning of this agroecosystem, permitting fish production while at the same time conserving biodiversity.</p>
            <p>Our results do not show an accumulation of organic matter in the sediments, as we predicted. Nevertheless, our results suggest that a dry year allows the mineralization of nitrogen in pond sediments and enhances the availability of mineral nitrogen in the water column during the first year after dry stand (Y1). In connection with these nutrient dynamics, this practice allows the restoration of a good primary productivity and a significant colonization by macrophytes. Indeed, it favours a domination of the agroecosystem by macrophytes with a low phytoplankton development in Y1. Drying out resets the systems towards a macrophyte dominate state. In connection with this, we also observed a higher specific diversity.</p>
            <p>The second year (Y2) marked the best state of balance between the two primary producers, an optimum unstable state for fish production. It was also the year with the highest density of invertebrates. These different elements explain why it was also the best year for fish yields.</p>
            <p>During the following years (Y3 and Y4), we observed a decrease in inorganic nutrients availability in the water, as well as in the cover and the species diversity of macrophytes, in favour of the quantity of phytoplankton.</p>
            <p>For ponds maintained in water for a longer period (more than five years), we observed a lower presence of the two primary producers: a low cover of macrophytes and a lower concentration of phytoplankton. The same was true for their diversity, which was at lower levels than in the first years. This change of functioning is beneficial for a detrivorous food web, also called microbial loop. The use of a dry period in these situations allows the rejuvenation of the ecosystem with a major disturbance. As we have seen, this allows a return to good levels of primary productivity and therefore fish production, while maintaining the highest levels of biodiversity.</p>
            <p>Drying ponds out for one year might also be a practice to be implemented regularly in some natural ponds where organic matter has accumulated, more than sediment dredging techniques which are expensive and often inefficient on a long-term scale.</p>

        <body>
            <p>The article entitled, &#x201c;Drying out fish ponds, for an entire growth season, as an agroecological practice: maintaining primary producers for fish production and biodiversity conservation&#x201d; contributes to an often overlooked area of agroecology by incorporating on-farm fish ponds. The consideration of the way that the pods relate to&#x00a0;nutrient cycling and on-farm aquatic biodiversity offers an important and potentially innovative contribution to the literature and the scientific measurements and sample sizes are generally robust.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Overall, I find the writing clear, the references well done and I think this will be of interest to readers of this journal. I do have several suggestions that could be useful for revisions, which I have organized according to the subsection below.</p>
            <p> </p>

                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>This same paragraph has a sequence of different propositions that either need more explanation and should be discussed in several separate paragraphs. There are ideas about why the pods were made commingled with ideas about how much biodiversity they sustain and if managed vs. unmanaged ones conserve more biodiversity.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>First 2 paragraphs were strong, but I was a bit lost with all of these ideas in the third paragraph.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>More clarity on why the dry out phase has been used used would be helpful.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>Strong clear statement of study goals and hypothesis - I would preview these earlier in the introduction.</p>

                        <p>Clear writing, robust research plan, and this section also helped further explain several questions I had in the introduction (see comments above).&#x00a0;</p>

                        <p>As another broader implication that authors may want to consider in the discussion, or suggest for future research in the conclusion, is the extent to which this study could contribute to a broader research agenda related to the agroecology-based management of water systems.</p>
