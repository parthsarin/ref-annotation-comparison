                <p>
                    <bold>Background</bold>: Open Access aims at improving the discovery, access and re-use of research not only within the scientific community, but also within broader society, for instance to promote innovation in industry. Yet, the extent to which openly available scientific work impacts technological inventions remains largely unknown.</p>
                <p>
                    <bold>Methods</bold>: We combine publicly available data sources about patents and scholarly publications to explore the extent to which Open Access scientific literature is cited in patents.</p>
                <p>
                    <bold>Results</bold>: Investigating over 22 million patent families indexed in Google Patents between 2010 and 2020, we found that around one third referenced non-patent literature. However, the number of references per patent family can vary considerably across technological sectors and inventor countries.  Based on a sample of 215,962 scientific non-patent references published between 2008 and 2020, we determined the Open Access status using

                    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://europepmc.org/">Europe PubMed Central</ext-link> and 
                    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</ext-link>.  The proportion of Open Access citations grew over the years, with nearly half of cited articles being openly available.</p>
                <p>
                    <bold>Discussion</bold>: In line with research on both technology-science linkage and Open Access, we found considerable country- and subject- specific variations.  In particular, patents representing inventions from the US and the UK cited Open Access work disproportionately more often, although it is challenging to link these observations to specific science policies and incentives. We recommend that follow-up research and monitoring exercise take advantage of a growing evidence base associated with patent citations and Open Access evidence.</p>

            <p>This research analyses patents in order to answer the question: what is the impact of open access to scientific publications on innovation? To answer this question, we measured citations from patents to open access full-texts. Our work describes a useful methodology and approach for others, who investigate the effects of open science on innovation using openly available big data sources.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>Open Science policies aim at improving the discovery, access and re-use of research not only within the scientific community, but also within broader society. Catalysing innovation is a major goal in this latter regard (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-6">ElSabry, 2017</xref>). Yet, the extent to which openly available scientific work impacts technological inventions remains largely unknown. Here, we combine publicly available data sources about patents and scholarly publications to explore uptake of Open Access to scientific literature cited in patents. In doing so, we expand existing patent citation analysis methodologies in order to provide evidence about the use of Open Access resources in innovation.</p>
            <p>According to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), &#x201c;a patent is an exclusive right granted for an invention&#x201d;
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN1">1</xref>
                </sup>, which, along with technical documentation, must be publicly disclosed as a patent application. To support any claims, patents can refer to other patents (patent-to-patent citations) and, to a lesser extent, to other types of work, termed non-patent literature (NPL) by the WIPO and large patent offices. The majority of NPL citations is to scholarly literature, also referred to as scientific non-patent-references (SNPR), while NPL can also include references to technical documentation or reports (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-36">van Raan, 2017</xref>).</p>
            <p>For more than 40 years, SNPR have been studied as an indicator of science-technology interactions. In their pioneering work, 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-5">Carpenter 
                    <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (1980)</xref> used patent citation analysis to determine the value of basic research to the economic, societal and technological development of a country. Since then, an increasing body of research has drawn on SNPR to study various aspects of the linkage between science and technology (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-36">van Raan, 2017</xref>). Likewise, evaluative patent citation analysis has become a monitoring tool to support policy-making.

                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN2">2</xref>
                </sup>
            </p>
            <p>Here, we apply patent citation analysis to measure the extent to which Open Access resources were mentioned in patents. Only a few studies so far focused particularly on Open Access to SNPR. Drawing on a combination of publicly available big data sources, we explore and analyse levels of Open Access in SNPR. In particular, we extracted typically used identifiers for scholarly publications from Google Patents and matched those with Unpaywall, Europe PMC and arXiv. The compiled data enabled us to analyse Open Access uptake levels by patent subject and inventor&#x2019;s country, as well as to relate our patent citation analysis to the overall growth of Open Access in scientific publishing.</p>

                <title>Characteristics of patent citations to scientific literature</title>
                <p>In patenting, both inventors and examiners are legally obliged to support claims made in the patent application through citations (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-36">van Raan, 2017</xref>). Particularly, US patent law requires that the patent examiner carefully selects references (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-35">Tijssen, 2001</xref>). Also, the European Patent Convention demands that examiners consult a variety of scientific literature and include documents, which are considered as most relevant (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-39">Verbandt &amp; Vadot, 2018</xref>). However, evidence suggests that most citations are made by the inventors themselves (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1">Ahmadpoor &amp; Jones, 2017</xref>).</p>
                <p>SNPR should not be interpreted in every case as constituting the key sources of an invention, but rather as indicative for a spectrum of science-technology interactions, ranging from signalling the &#x201c;awareness of scientific results&#x201d; to considerable direct contributions to the innovation (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-35">Tijssen, 2001</xref>). Drawing on patents from the field of nano-scale technologies, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-24">Meyer (2000)</xref> found that SNPR mainly represent the more general background of an invention, rather than a direct link. Interviewing inventors, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-4">Callaert 
                        <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2014)</xref> confirmed that SNPR rarely acted as a source of inspiration for technological invention.</p>
                <p>Research has revealed important trends in patent citation practices. First of all, several studies observed a highly-skewed distribution of NPL, with a large proportion of patents lacking any references at all (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-36">van Raan, 2017</xref>). 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-3">Callaert 
                        <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2006)</xref> estimated that 55% United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and 64% European Patent Office (EPO) of NPL are SNPR published in journals. There is, however, conflicting evidence concerning coverage across journals. While 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-12">Guerrero-Bote 
                        <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2021)</xref> estimated that within five years, patent citations cover one third of Scopus-indexed journals, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-36">van Raan&#x2019;s (2017)</xref> comprehensive review found that SNPR appeared only in a small group of journals. In another work on &#x201c;sleeping beauties&#x201d;, publications whose impact (in terms of citations) is not immediate but grows over time, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-37">van Raan &amp; Winnink (2018)</xref>, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-38">van Raan &amp; Winnink (2019)</xref> noticed a considerable time-lag between an SNPR&#x2019; publication date and the patent application, although the lag has shortened over the years due to inventor-author self-citations. Scientific articles, which made a novel contribution to a field, are significantly more likely cited in patents (

Cross-country comparisons need to take national citation practices into account in the interpretations of their findings, which are governed by the respective patenting law as well as the availability of literature (

                <p>While an increasing body of research focuses on Open Access to scientific research articles (

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2">Bryan and Ozcan (2020)</xref> investigated a sample of 43 medical and biotechnology journals published between 2005 and 2012. Similar to the effect on public sector research (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-34">Staudt, 2020</xref>), they found a modest increase in citations to NIH-funded research after the introduction of the NIH Open Access policy, while citation rates to non-funded research stagnated. Focusing on small biotechnology companies, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2">Bryan and Ozcan (2020)</xref> found that these companies likely benefit most from Open Access, because they require access to robust and specific scientific knowledge, but are too small for costly subscriptions. The positive impact of Open Access publications on innovation seems to be particularly strong amongst small- and medium-sized enterprises without collaborators at universities or other public research institutions who usually have access to subscription journals (

                <p>A recurring theme in the quantitative study of patent citations is the difficulty of identifying NPL generally and SNPR in particular. NPL are provided as text strings, making it difficult to analyse them (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-36">van Raan, 2017</xref>). In recent years, the application of big data analytic tools for patent citation analysis can be observed. For instance, 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-21">Knaus and Palzenberger (2018)</xref> applied a Solr full text search procedure on the EPO worldwide bibliographic data (DOCDB), the EPO core reference raw data product.

                    </ext-link>, we used Google Patents because of its analytical interface provided by Google Big Query, a high-performant cloud-based database for big data analytics. The database interface allows querying NPL in-text citations with 
                    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</ext-link>. This enabled us to query the Google patent corpus with regular expressions indicating typically used identifiers to refer to scholarly publications without setting up our own computing environment to analyse large amounts of bulk patent data. Then, we parsed the obtained identifiers with regular expressions from the unstructured text strings and collated them into a new dataset using the following scholarly data sources.</p>

                <p>As the first type of identifier, we searched NPL for Digital Object Identifiers (DOI). Then, we used 
                    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://unpaywall.org/">Unpaywall</ext-link> to determine SNPR including their Open Access status. This Open Access discovery service checks for links to openly available full texts for all DOIs registered by Crossref (

                        <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). To prepare the match with Unpaywall using DOIs, we extracted syntactically valid DOI patterns using the

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-13">Held, 2021</xref>). Then, we obtained metadata from Unpaywall using the parsed DOIs. We used the publicly available Unpaywall dump from July 2021, restricting ourselves to publications published after 2008. To allow for efficient data manipulation and retrieval, we imported the Unpaywall dump to Google Big Query.</p>
                <p>Not all scholarly literature is referenced by DOIs, but researchers make use of other types of unique identifiers. In biomedicine and the life sciences, the use of PubMed identifiers is a common practice to provide references to scientific articles. 
                    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubMed</ext-link> is a widely used and comprehensive literature database of research articles in these fields. Following previous SNPR reference matching approaches that complement DOIs with PubMed identifiers (

                        <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>), we queried Google Patents Big Query interface for the standard identifiers PubMed-ID (PMID) and PubMed Central reference number (PMCID). While the former represents metadata about a scholarly publication in PubMed, the latter provides linkage to 
                    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed Central</ext-link>, a free full text archive of PubMed-indexed literature. Again, we started by querying the NPL in-text citations for patterns indicating PMIDs and PMCIDs. Next, we extracted candidate IDs using regular expressions. The matching to PubMed / PubMed Central was carried out by retrieving metadata from Europe PMC, which is a PubMed mirror and allows searching PubMed metadata and the PubMed Central repository simultaneously (

                <p>We also mined arXiv identifiers.

Similar to the situation in biomedicine and the life sciences, citing an arXiv document through a unique identifier is recommended.

                <p>Drawing on the compiled data allowed us not only to investigate the prevalence of Open Access resources in our sample, but also the type of Open Access provision. Here, we drew on Unpaywall&#x2019;s classification of the Open Access host, which distinguishes between publisher and repository-provided Open Access. Because versions of the Open Access full text can be provided by publishers and repositories at the same time, we distinguished between Open Access full texts provided only by publishers (&#x201c;Publisher only&#x201d;) or repositories (&#x201c;Repositories only&#x201d;), or both (&#x201c;Publisher &amp; Repositories&#x201d;). We extended this classification to SNPR linked to Europe PMC. PMC largely consists of full texts, which were made freely available in collaboration with publishers (

SNPR indexed in the arxiv were coded as (&#x201c;Repositories only&#x201d;), although a considerable number of journals in subjects covered by the arxiv have become Open Access as well (

            <p>This section first presents the results of our large-scale analysis with a view on patent families published between 2010 and 2020 with reference to non-patent literature (NPL) by year, inventor countries and patent subject. Then, we present a more detailed analysis of our compiled data about scientific non-patent references (SNPR), that we obtained by parsing unique identifiers from in-text patent citations, which could be mapped to scholarly work published between 2008&#x2013;2020. The focus of the SNPR analysis is on the Open Access uptake by year and type of provision relative to the country of affiliation of the inventor and patent subjects.</p>

In total, we found 24,752,870 unique NPL text strings in the investigated period. On average, 8.23 NPL text strings were cited per patent family with NPL. The median number of NPL citations was 2, the maximum number of NPL citations was 10,645.</p>

                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> also shows a proportional decrease of NPL. This lag between the publication date of patents and the inclusion of NPL is not surprising, because scholarly work supporting patents can be provided after the publication of a patent (

Patent families classified in the CPC sections &#x201c;C - Chemistry; metallurgy&#x201d; and &#x201c;A - Human necessities&#x201d; had the highest NPL percentage.

                <p>Mapping unique identifiers parsed from NPL text strings and resolving them against Unpaywall, Europe PMC and arXiv offers insight into the extent to which SNPR are Open Access. First, we explore the share of Open Access. Then, we provide an overview about the Open Access venues. Overall, we were able to extract 215,962 scholarly data identifiers, constituting the sample for our Open Access analysis. 96,228 SNPR had an Open Access full text, representing an Open Access availability rate of 45%.</p>

                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref> illustrates the number of SNPR in our sample by Open Access availability over the years. It reveals that the majority of scholarly publications in our sample were published before 2015. As expected, 
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref> suggests an increasing share of Open Access for more recent publications. Open Access uptake rates grew from 35% in 2008 to 82% in 2020. Note that the total number of SNPR in our sample decreased over time. In conjunction with the small number of normalised SNPR relative to the overall number of NPL text strings in our sample, these data artefacts necessitate a careful interpretation of our results.</p>

                <p>Interestingly, SNPR not only included preprints from arxiv.org (n = 8,317), but also from other subject-specific preprint archives, in particular from bioRxiv (n = 154), which targets research in biology and the life sciences.

                    </sup> Launched in 2013, bioRxiv recently gained popularity as a platform to rapidly communicate life science research related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This trend can be also observed in our data: thirty-three recently published bioRxiv preprints, which were cited in patents, are related to COVID-19 research.</p>

                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref> reveals that the SNPR Open Access share is larger than the overall average across journals.  However, the yearly distribution follows the general trend of an increasing proportion of journal articles becoming openly available. The peak in 2020 in the SNPR Open Access percentage might be due to a data artefact; only a small number of articles from the year 2020 were cited in patents.</p>

            <title>Discussion</title>
            <p>Using openly available big data sources, this paper has presented a large-scale view of the state of citation practices within patents to non-patent literature (NPL), and especially use of Open Access resources among scientific non-patent references (SNPR). Overall, we found that around one third of patent families were supported by at least one NPL, although the number of references per patent family can vary considerably across subjects and inventor countries, which is in accordance with previous research (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-19">Jefferson 
                    <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>).</p>
            <p>To obtain the SNPR Open Access status, we parsed unique identifiers representing scientific work from the Google Patents corpus and matched them with the scholarly data sources Unpaywall, Europe PMC and arXix. In doing so, we were able to compile a data sample comprising 215,962 SNPR, which were cited by 146,382 patent families. Overall, we found that nearly half of all identifiable SNPR in our sample are openly available.</p>
            <p>Over the years, the Open Access rate for SNPR representing journal articles was above that of Unpaywall, a major OA discovery service, indicating that openly available scientific articles are more likely cited in patents. In line with previous research, we found considerable disciplinary and country-specific variations (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-16">Huang 
                    <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>;

                    <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). Concerning differences between countries, it is interesting to speculate here about the extent to which these differences are due to differences in levels of access to scientific literature for the innovators themselves, or whether they might also reflect the extent to which examiners from patent offices adding references themselves can access the evidence. Unfortunately, our data does not allow us to draw any conclusions on this point, but we flag it here as a possible route for future research.</p>
            <p>Concerning disciplinary differences, it is interesting to note that patents belonging to the CPC section &#x201c;A - human necessities&#x201d; stand out. These patents show not only a stronger link to research in terms of the penetration of SNPR, but also to research that is openly available. This is in line with previous research. Piwowar found the highest Open Access rate among scientific articles published in biomedicine journals (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-28">Piwowar 
                    <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>).</p>
            <p>Only a few studies have attempted to measure the impact of Open Access on innovation through examining patents citing NPL. Drawing on a sample of 43 prestigious life science journals that published 132,872 research articles between 2005 and 2012 and U.S. patent applications since 2005, 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2">Bryan and Ozcan (2020)</xref> found a slight positive effect of the Open Access mandate of the NIH to the citation of SNPR. NIH-funded research was cited much more often after the introduction of the NIH research, ranging between 12% and 27%. Similarly, 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-7">ElSabry and Sumikura (2020)</xref> observed an increasing uptake of articles from Open Access journals in patents from American pharmaceutical companies. In line with our findings, they observed considerable variations by subject.</p>
            <p>Although a majority of bibliometric studies suggest that Open Access articles are cited more often than closed-access articles (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-22">Langham-Putrow 
                    <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>), potential biases need to be considered, both relative to scholarly communication in general and to patent citation in particular. Our observed above-average Open Access share could be explained by the selection bias according to which authors tend to make their work openly available, where they expect most impact in terms of citations (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-8">Eysenbach, 2006</xref>). As our literature review has shown, previous research found a substantial body of author-inventor self-citations across SNPR. Inventors tend not only to cite their own work, but also scientific articles from their country. Moreover, inventors tend to cite background work to demonstrate knowledge, while research directly linked to the invention is cited to a lesser extent. Furthermore, previous research highlights a considerable link between the country affiliation of an invention and the cited SNPR. National policies and Open Access funder mandates have strongly influenced how this publishing model is implemented, resulting in varying country-specific uptake rates. We found particularly strong uptake rates among inventions from the US and UK. Particularly British universities had the largest share of OA publications, but also the US ranked above the global average (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-32">Robinson-Garcia 
                    <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>).</p>
            <p>In contrast to previous research, our study is not limited to journal articles, but also takes other types of scholarly work into account. This hence presents a key contribution of this study. We were able to confirm the use of preprints in the information seeking behaviour in patenting. Not only preprints from the well-established arXiv were cited, but also preprints from 
                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/">bioRxiv</ext-link>, which, together with the sister repository 
                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.medrxiv.org/">medRxiv</ext-link>, has gained prominence since COVID-19 for accelerated communication of scientific results (

                    <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). Contrasting the lag between preprint publication and citation in a patent furthermore suggests that preprints are cited timelier in patents than other types of scholarly work. However, previous research highlighted the large proportion of delayed Open Access. Indeed, a considerable proportion of Open Access articles indexed in Unpaywall was made available after an embargo period (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-29">Piwowar 
                    <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>).</p>
            <p>We also considered different ways of providing Open Access, whereas 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-7">ElSabry and Sumikura (2020)</xref> focused on Open Access Journals only and 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2">Bryan and Ozcan (2020)</xref> on the discipline-specific repository PubMed Central. Our findings show that Open Access provided by repositories is most common, although many Open Access SNPR were provided by both repositories and journals. For instance, 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-23">Larivi&#x00e8;re &amp; Sugimoto (2018)</xref> showed that most funded research results were simultaneously shared. This implies that inventors and patent examiners could have benefited from a diverse landscape of Open Access publishing options, which are not limited to publishing in journals. Indeed, patent offices already make use of federated Open Access discovery during the patent examination. The most widely used tools for searching and retrieving scientific articles at the EPO are Google Scholar, Scopus and PubMed. All these discovery solutions currently provide unified access to various Open Access publishing services (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-39">Verbandt &amp; Vadot, 2018</xref>).</p>
            <p>Our study is limited in various aspects. One and most important is that NPL citations are only accessible as text strings, which need to be parsed and mapped to scholarly data sources. So far, no openly available evidence base exists to measure the influence of Open Access to the scholarly literature on patents. Lens.org provides a graphical user interface to analyse SNPR citations to Open Access documents, but it is not suitable for large-scale analyses as presented here. Because of the large number of patent citations manual matching would not be possible. The limited resources of our work furthermore prevented us from expanding our method by drawing on an increasing number of reference matching and text classification approaches like BERT (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-42">Voskuil &amp; Verberne, 2021</xref>). Instead, we made use of identifiers in NPL text strings and mapped them to publicly available scholarly data sources. It must be noted, however, that our investigated data sources are selective towards scholarly journals, while lacking other important NPL types, particularly grey literature like technical documentations or standards. In fact, only a small proportion of NPL strings contained an identifier like a DOI, which is widely common in scholarly publishing, but less, for instance, in the grey literature field.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, we lack evidence about how valid our SNPR sample is to draw conclusions about the citation motivation. We have no evidence about who cited the NPL, and when. Was the work cited by the inventor, or did it happen through the patent office? We also lack information about the availability of discovery solutions. For instance, the European Patent Office added more and more scholarly literature databases in prior art search, including Open Access full text databases (
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-39">Verbandt &amp; Vadot, 2018</xref>), which might have led to an increase in citations to openly available SNPR. Moreover, due to our research design, we did not test how representative our sample is. Therefore, careful interpretation of our findings is needed, when drawing general conclusions about the Open Access uptake in the SNPR.</p>
            <p>Future studies will likely benefit from such an improved evidence base associated with Open Access and patents. During the course of our work, the search engine lens.org has started to offer bulk download of its underlying data for academic use. In its data, metadata about patent families is linked to disambiguated bibliographic metadata and includes Open Access status information. But also, public patent offices curate large databases about NPL. Bulk access, as in the case of the EPO worldwide bibliographic data (DOCDB), for large-scale analytical purposes, is not directly possible. Given the importance of monitoring the influence of science on innovation, we recommend that these essential data sources will be made available without restrictions to the public, ideally in cloud-based big data analytics environments like Google Big Query.</p>

            <title>Conclusion</title>
            <p>Open Access literature is a widely used and reputable source for scientific information in innovation. Our big data analysis shows that the share of Open Access among scientific non-patent references in patents was above the general trend. Combining structured patent data with scholarly data sources with a focus on Open Access opens up the opportunity to better understand patterns of Open Access adoption. In this regard, and in line with the literature review conducted, we found the comparison across countries of inventors and technological fields as promising indicators to analyse the Open Access uptake in innovation.</p>
            <p>While our data analysis suggests that scientific articles cited in patents are more likely openly available in comparison to the general trend, it is challenging to link it to specific science policies and incentives. Overall, analysing the nature of science-technology linkage particularly with regard to Open Access is complex. Meanwhile, there are notable activities to interlink patent information with big scholarly data both in academia and in industry. These activities promise an improved evidence-base and monitoring system to measure technology-science linkage with a focus on Open Access.</p>

        <body>
            <p>The empirical test of the diffusion of OA articles in patent citations is a novel and interesting research for the assessment of the impact of OA practice.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The framing of the research question could be improved, for example: 1) Are OA articles cited in patents more frequently than non-OA? 2) Are they cited earlier?</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> However, the contribution in this article seems more on the method of identification of NPL and SNPR than on the question. This should be cleared from the beginning.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The descriptive statistics on the diffusion of OA in SNPRs are only preliminary depicting the status. For example, if the pool of open access articles is increasing, then it is more likely they are cited, not because they can be accessed by more people but because they are more. The comparison with the share of OA in Unpaywall is a preliminary way to overcome this limitation but the difference can be driven by sector specificities: if there are differences in the share of OA articles across research areas, then it could be the case that areas usually not cited by patents are less propense to see OA articles. Considering that OA is often a costly choice, it is likely that "poorer" research areas have less OA and that hard sciences, especially close to industrial applications (i.e., patenting), have more resources to pay for the OA.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Another confounding factor is the assumption that there is no difference between open-access and non-open-access articles in terms of quality. If OA articles were on average of higher quality than the non-OA articles, then they would be cited more in patents because of their higher relevance and not because of the larger accessibility. As it is reported in the cited article by (Veugelers &amp; Wang, 2019).&#x00a0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The two Sections "Open Access to scientific non-patent references (SNPR)" and "Evidence-base associated with patents and scientific non-patent references (SNPR)" could be reorganized with the aim to clearly address the results of the literature on SNPR that considered also the OA characteristic and link them to the contribution of this study.&#x00a0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> In this section, the few articles dealing with OA should be summarised also with respect to their results (e.g., share of OA) and not only for the empirical settings and the arguments the authors raised.&#x00a0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The identification of NPL and SNPR is not an easy task and several articles proposed different approaches. The authors have mentioned some of the previous works that systematically identified NPL/SNPR on large datasets but the focus here should be on the identification of OA among SNPRs. In the case the authors want to focus on their identification method, including the NPL, then they should also compare their results with some of the other studies that identified NPL.&#x00a0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> In any case, the methodologically aspects would find a better positioning in the corresponding "Methods" section for comparison with the authors' approach.&#x00a0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Table 1 is not a summary of the workflow (a figure with the workflow would help) and the meaning of the reported numbers is not completely clear. For example, I understand that 240,010 is the number of patent families with at least one SNPR that was identified in Unpaywall (with any access policy?) but then I do not understand what 230,108 represents. Does "matched" mean that the DOI is valid? From the last two columns I understand that the articles between 2008 and 2020 are cited by 137,498 patent families out of 240,010 patent families: are those the patent families published between 2010 and 2020?</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> There are several definitions of a patent family (simple, INPADOC, DOCDB). Which one was employed? The reported definition ("a collection of patent applications covering the same or similar technical content") might refer also to different patents dealing with the same technology. This is not a trivial aspect in your research setting since it might affect the time lag between NPL and patents.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> SNPR are limited to &gt;2008 while your patent data are published between 2010-2020. These two choices (time window for SNPR and publication as reference year for patents) might introduce some biases in your empirical framework.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> First, patent publication date can be far from the date of the invention, which is best represented by the earliest priority date, especially when using patent families. Which publication year was selected among all the family members? In addition, recent patent data are usually incomplete, not only for the 18 months non-disclosure window but also for the extension mechanisms in the available routes (e.g. PCT) and for other electronic publication delays. I would not consider the last 5 years in this setting.</p>
            <p> The choice of the time frame for searching the SNPR in Unpaywall and the other sources cannot be too close to the starting date of the selected patent families. As you reported, "van Raan &amp; Winnink (2018), van Raan &amp; Winnink (2019) noticed a considerable time-lag between an SNPR&#x2019; publication date and the patent application, although the lag has shortened over the years due to inventor-author self-citations". Fig4 reinforces that you might be dropping out a non-negligible left tail.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> For all these reasons, the analyses on the lag between NPL and patents cannot be considered robust at the moment (e.g., Fig6, 7).</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Fig1 would be more interesting if it reported the share of patent families citing at least one NPL in time. The comment on lag ("This lag between the publication date...") cannot be derived from Fig1 since it does not report any information on the time lag between patents and cited NPL.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The information on the missing country of residence of the inventors is quite surprising. It might relate to the construction of the patent families. I strongly suggest to validate your strategy for the identification of families and explain why 13M out of 22M families have no information on the residence address of the inventors.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> I am not sure why you are interested in the residence country of the inventors. If you want to highlight strategic behaviors or common practices of the examination process, I would expect an analysis based on patent offices. Since you are focusing on patent families, you could select the first priority country and provide the same statistics with an improved accuracy. If you do not have this piece of information, inventors' residence is a credible proxy, but in this case you should clarify why there are so many missing data points and what is the impact of such issue on the evidence.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Minor aspects</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> "Only a few studies so far focused particularly on Open Access to SNPR". Anticipating the references here would provide the proper credit to those studies.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Typo: "Although other search engines exist that link patents to NPL and SNPL lens.org,..."</p>
            <p>If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?</p>
            <p>Partly</p>
            <p>Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?</p>
            <p>Partly</p>
            <p>Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it engage with the current literature?</p>
            <p>Partly</p>
            <p>Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?</p>
            <p>Partly</p>
            <p>Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?</p>
            <p>Partly</p>

            <p>The paper is a very important contribution to an underserved research topic, namely the societal impact of open access to academic literature (i.e. the uses of open access literature in non-academic contexts). It is based on extracting in-text citations to academic literature from patent documents and matching them to a number of scholarly databases to identify their open access status. It has shown that open access resources are over-represented in patent citations and has concluded that this supports the already existing evidence on the impact on open access on industrial innovation. Further analysis was conducted to investigate the impact of patent subject, inventor country and type of OA on the observed trends.</p>

            <p> I would like to categorize my comments on this paper into two sets.&#x00a0;</p>
            <p> The first set is about choices made by the authors, which do not seem to be thoroughly justified in the paper.&#x00a0; 
                <list list-type="bullet">
                    <list-item>
                        <p>The indexing lag in Google Patents which caused the drop in the number of patent families after 2018 is a common phenomenon experienced by empirical researchers in similar fields. In some cases such periods are truncated from the data for fear of introducing biases (inherited from the reasons behind indexing lags, for example, indexing patents from a particular patent office faster than other offices). The authors' choice to include patents published after 2018 should have been accompanied by some justification on why this will not bias the data.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>Because patent data covers the period from 2010 to 2020, the authors have decided to include SNPL sources published since 2008. This is understandable given that research papers take time to disseminate and reach different categories of readers/users. However, it is not clear why the authors chose to limit this lag to two years, while at the same time their analysis suggests that the median length of this lag is 5 years.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>It is mentioned in the paper that citations can be added to patent documents after their publication. It is not clear how this is possible. It is also not clear how the cited reference (Guerrero-Bote 
                            <italic>et al</italic>., 2021) supports this claim. What is well-known is that inventors or examiners can add references after submitting the &#x201c;patent application&#x201d;, which brings up a question about the type of patent documents used by the authors in this study. Is it only granted patents? or does it include patent applications as well?</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>It is not clearly stated in the paper if the authors have run checks to identify any potential duplicates among the 215,962 sources identified (for example, a paper published by PMC and detected by Unpaywall at the same time).</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>Including geographical analysis was indeed an important addition to the study. However, since the majority of patent families (64%) have no information on the inventor country, more investigation was needed to at least explain why so much data was missing (and maybe also some confirmation that such missing data will not bias the results).</p>
                    </list-item>
                </list> 
         </p>
            <p> The second set consists of a number of suggestions that would help improve the quality of the paper, either by introducing changes to other versions or by carrying out further research to cover these additional points. 
                <list list-type="bullet">
                    <list-item>
                        <p>The study used only in-text NPL references in patent documents, as opposed to using front-page NPL. This is already a choice made by a number of other studies and some evidence exists on the fact that in-text citations might be a better proxy in &#x201c;science-linkage&#x201d; studies. It would have been better to include such discussion in the paper.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>It is mentioned in the study that researchers faced a difficulty in identifying which of the journals covered in the arxiv database were open access journals. Perhaps one way to do so is to match the list of journals in arxiv with the publicly available DOAJ data.</p>
                    </list-item>
                </list> Finally, a minor proofreading remark. It seems the statement &#x201c;NIH-funded research was cited much more often after the introduction of the NIH research&#x201d; should be edited to read &#x201c;NIH-funded research was cited much more often after the introduction of the NIH 
                <bold>Open Access Mandate</bold>&#x201d;</p>
            <p>If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it engage with the current literature?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Are all the source data and materials underlying the results available?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Reviewer Expertise:</p>
            <p>STI Policy, Strategic Innovation Management</p>
            <p>I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above.</p>
