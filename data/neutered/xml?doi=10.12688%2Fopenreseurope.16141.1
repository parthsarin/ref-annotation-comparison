                <p>It is common for people working on linguistic geography, language contact and typology to make use of some type of distance metric between lects. However, most work so far has either used Euclidean distances, or geodesic distance, both of which do not represent the real separation between communities very accurately. This paper presents two datasets: one on walking distances and one on topographic distances between over 8700 lects across all macro-areas. We calculated walking distances using Open Street Maps data, and topographic distances using digital elevation data. We evaluate these distances. We evaluate these distance metrics on three case studies and show that topographic distance tends to outperform the other distance metrics, but geodesic distances can be used as an adequate approximation in some cases.</p>

            <title>5.1 Introduction</title>
            <p>Studying language contact, spatial diffusion, and typology (among others) requires having reliable distances measurements between linguistic communities. However, most work so far has used either Euclidean or geodesic distances (see 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-6">Guzm&#x00e1;n Naranjo &amp; Becker, 2021</xref>; 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-17">Murawaki &amp; Yamauchi, 2018</xref>; 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-21">Ranacher 
                    <italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2021</xref>, for an example). Both these approaches, however, make some relatively simplified and unrealistic assumptions about the spatial separation of human populations. Euclidean distances assume that the earth is flat, and geodesic distances assume that the surface of the earth is a smooth sphere. While these assumptions can be warranted in some situations (e.g. communities which are very close together, or in individual islands), using these metrics leads to bias estimates of the separation of speech communities.</p>
            <p>As a way of addressing these issues, a method for calculating approximate walking distances was recently proposed by 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-26">Wichmann &amp; Hammarstr&#x00f6;m (2020)</xref>, who propose a computationally efficient technique. This method, however, is not exact because it does not attempt to actually follow known walking pathways, but rather, uses population centres to route the paths. Another recent alternative for a computationally efficient approximation is proposed by 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-9">Kaiping (2021)</xref>, who calculates exact walking distances between the centre of geographic nodes (hexagons). Each node has an area of roughly 78 square km. Distances between languages are then calculated as the distance between the centres of these hexagons. While impressive, this method is also not exact, and we are not aware of evaluations of how good the resulting distances are for linguistic purposes.</p>
            <p>In this paper we do several things. Our main aim is to provide a resource in the form of distance matrices, that can be used for typologists and linguists in general to study contact. Second, we explore the question of how different distance metrics compare to each other. While there are several conceptual problems with using Euclidean and geodesic distances, there has been no attempt at quantifying how much better more realistic distance metrics are.</p>
            <p>The structure of this paper is as follows. 
                <xref ref-type="other" rid="S5.2">Section 5.2</xref> gives a brief mathematical and computational description of the four distance metrics we will look at in this paper: Euclidean distances, geodesic distances, topographic distances and walking distances. 
                <xref ref-type="other" rid="S5.4">Section 5.4</xref> describes a case study on modelling potential contact with the different datasets. Finally,

                <p>This type of distance has been used explicitly (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-6">Guzm&#x00e1;n Naranjo &amp; Becker, 2021</xref>), but also implicitly, in the form of adding latitude or longitude to a statistical model (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-24">Verkerk &amp; Di Garbo, 2022</xref>). The main reason for its relatively widespread popularity is simple: it is the simplest and fasted distance metric we can calculate for two points, and it can be obtained from latitude and longitude information. In terms of modelling, this distance metric also presents some advantages, namely the fact that popular Bayesian software like STAN or INLA provide ready-made solutions that make very efficient use of Euclidean distances for spatial models.

                <p>Despite these advantages, there are several potential downsides. This distance metric assumes that the points in question lie on a plane, but this is evidently not true for two populations on the earth. For relatively short distances, and distances on the Equator, this is mostly not a problem, especially because we do not expect high accuracy in the centres from which we measure the distances. However, for larger distances, and distance far away from the Equator, Euclidean distance can produce results which are very different from actual distances along the surface of the Earth.</p>

                    </sup> Given that the geodesic distance takes into account the curvature of the earth, it is a likely better representation of the separation of two populations. Nonetheless, it also makes several simplified assumptions about the topography of the space between two points. Most importantly, the geodesic distance assumes a smooth surface, without hills, valleys or any other topographic barrier. While this assumption may be justified for cases like the steppe or island archipelagos, it is likely overly optimistic in places with very rugged terrains, mountain ranges, and similar geographic features.</p>
                <p>Computationally, this distance is unproblematic, and we will not discuss the technical aspects any further. We calculated the geodesic distance between all lects in Glottolog with the

                <p>The topographic distance (or how the wolf runs) is the shortest distance between two points, but we include the elevation changes in between both points. This is the distance along an uneven, rugged surface. To calculate topographic distances we used the 
                    <monospace>gdistance</monospace> package (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-22">van Etten, 2017</xref>) in R. Given its computational challenges, some words on the matter are necessary at this point.</p>
                <p>Calculating topographic distances requires building an incidence matrix (a graph of connections between all points) with a digital elevation model (DEM) raster of the region containing the points of interest. Thus, the first step is to assemble a DEM for the region of interest, which, in our case, is the whole world. There are many sources for elevation data freely available, but not all datasets cover the whole planet (the northern most and southern most areas are often missing). For this we used the Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data 2010 (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-3">Danielson &amp; Gesch, 2011</xref>), which does cover the whole globe, and is available at different resolutions (30-, 15-, and 7.5-arc-seconds). While ideally one would use the highest resolution possible, this is not computationally feasible for large areas. We have access to a High Performance Computing server with about 800 GB of ram, but found this was not sufficient to build the incidence matrix for any macro area at the 7.5- or 15-arc-second resolution. For this reason, we used the 30-arc-second resolution of the data,
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN5">5</xref>
                    </sup> which roughly corresponds to about 1 square km per pixel (i.e. we cannot consider elevation changes that cover less that 1 km).</p>
                <p>Given a DEM, we can calculate the incidence matrix as the transitions between any two points in the map. The transition between two points is given by &#x221a;(

                    <italic toggle="yes">h</italic> is the horizontal distance between two points, and 
                    <italic toggle="yes">v</italic> the elevation difference. With the incidence matrix for the whole DEM, we can then calculate the shortest path between two points using Dijkstra algorithm, or any other similar algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph (see 
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-25">Wang, 2020</xref>, for a more in-depth explanation).</p>
                <p>However, even at a relatively low resolution, calculating topographic distances is still very resource intensive. Given these computational challenges, we only calculated distances between languages within different macro-areas. Additionally, for North America and Eurasia, we were not able to compute the incidence matrix for the whole macro-area and had to divide these into four, partially overlapping quadrants, and calculate the distance between languages for each quadrant. After having the distances for all points within each quadrant, we propagated the distances across quadrants using points in the overlapping regions.</p>
                <p>A recent paper worth mentioning here is

The method used by the authors is similar to the one we present, but it attempts to calculate the travel time using a function to approximate hiking times, instead of taking the actual distance directly. In their study, the authors calculated the travel distances for 77 languages in the Americas, so it does not really represent the type of data we are trying to build in this study.</p>

                <title>5.2.4 Walking distances</title>
                <p>For the purposes of this paper, the walking distance between two points is the distance along mapped roads, walkways and paths that connect those two points. The idea is that road networks are a close representation of the spatial separation between populations because they are the actual pathways used for communication between communities.</p>
                <p>For this paper we are using the Open Stree Maps dataset (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-19">OpenStreetMap contributors, 2017</xref>) which contains information on roads and other infrastructure for most of the world.

                        <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN6">6</xref>
                    </sup> For the routing we use the OSRM routing engine (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-15">Luxen &amp; Vetter, 2011</xref>).</p>
                <p>There are, however, some pitfalls calculating walking distances with this approach. These difficulties come from lack of connectivity between points on the map. This lack of connectivity arises in the case of islands which are not joined to the mainland by ferry,
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN7">7</xref>
                    </sup> and some locations without roads or other transitable pathways. The later situation was especially present for languages in the Amazon.</p>
                <p>Currently, we do not have any good way to solve this issue. A workaround one can take is to fill in the gaps by using geodesic distances when there are no roads. This approach should provide reasonable results for islands (given that communication between islands and the mainland would have been mostly as direct routes on ship), but it is only a rough approximation for unconnected points in the jungle.</p>
                <p>We provide two datasets for the walking distances. One dataset has missing connections for these cases, and the other dataset tries to fill in these missing connections with a simple algorithm which sequentially connects the whole network to the nearest (by geodesic distance) off-network point.</p>
                <p>Regarding computational issues, two observations are important. First, OSRM cannot build a graph (the data structure needed for the routing) for the whole world, which meant we had to work on each macro-area individually. Second, in computational terms, we found that the preprocessing steps to prepare the Open Street Maps data took a couple of weeks, but having built the OSRM graphs, calculating the actual distances is extremely efficient. Generally speaking, walking distances are easier to calculate than topographic distances on a moderately powerful server.</p>

                <p>So far we have discussed four possible ways of calculating the distance between two points. It is useful to compare what the actual paths look like for the different distance metrics. 
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> provides an example of the paths between three points (the locations of three languages) in the Hindu-Kush area (see next section) for the four distance metrics. It is clear that the topographic, Euclidean and geodesic distances are relatively similar to each other, with the topographic path being less straight than the other two. However, the walking path is very different from the other three, and it takes a less straight route.</p>

                </fig>
                <p>In computational terms, the topographic distances are the most challenging to compute. They require a considerable amount of resources, and can take several weeks for a single macro-area. Both the Euclidean and geodesic distances are the most efficient, and the walking distances sit somewhere in the middle.</p>
                <p>The next three sections present three case studies in which we use these distance metrics to predict grammatical features of languages. The idea of these studies is not to gain linguistic insight, but to evaluate the predictive performance of the different metrics discussed here. To keep the models as simple as possible we will not consider any covariates outside the spatial term.</p>

Each case study presents a more detailed overview of each dataset, but in general terms each of these datasets comprises languages annotated for multiple binary features. This is important because in this study we limit ourselves to logistic regression to make all comparisons equal.

                <p>In terms of types of linguistic features, the Hindu-Kush data combines phonology, lexical and syntactic features; the South America data exclusively comprises word order features; and the European data is made up of phoneme inventories.

                <p>The original dataset includes annotations for 80 binary features, from phonology to syntax. Since the values of many of these feature were identical for all or almost all languages, we removed features with fewer than 10 or more than 49 positive values. This left us with a total of 48 features.

                <p>Looking at the Hindu-Kush region is particularly interesting for two reasons. First, contact effects have been extensively documented for this area (

                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>, which means that simple Euclidean and geodesic distances are likely biased estimates of the actual separation between communities (see also

                <p>These results are somewhat unexpected in that they show that there is no clear, systematic winner among the four distance metrics. Even the Euclidean distance, which we could expect to be the least accurate of the four, has the highest accuracy for some of the features like Possessive Suffixes and Oblique Object Word Order. Similarly, the topographic and walking distances perform rather poorly in features like Retroflex Fricatives and P Agreement (respectively). What this shows is that it is not instantly clear that one distance metric is better than the others in all cases.</p>

                <p>Going by these results, the walking distance outperforms the other distance metrics in 17 of the 48 features, followed by the topographic distance, then geodesic distance and finally Euclidean distance, which perform considerably worse. In terms of average balanced accuracy, the walking distances also seems to perform slightly better than the others.</p>
                <p>We can visualise the differences in the models by plotting the conditional effects of a couple of these models. The conditional effects of a spatial model are predictions of a grid of points on the area in question (from 69 to 77.5 longitude, and from 33.2 to 38.5 latitude, with steps of 0.05, for a total of 18297 points). To build these predictions, we need to calculate the distance from each point in the grid to each of the languages in the dataset. Because walking distances are sensitive to there being an accessible road from the point in question, it is not possible to build the required matrix for the conditional effects of walking distances, at least not for this area of the world.

                <p>In both cases, the difference is that the Euclidean distance build a much stronger areal effect structure, with more extreme probabilities at the peaks. In contrast, both the areal patterns of the topographic and geodesic distances are smoother, and less extreme. This arises because Euclidean distances are overall shorter than either geodesic or topographic distances, which makes the model infer stronger spatial dependencies. However, in this case, inferring stronger spatial relations leads to overgeneralization and incorrect predictions.</p>
                <p>One thing which this modelling approach fails to capture is the fact that a higher accuracy might not reflect the real contact situation. That is, the fact that in some cases the Euclidean distances produced better predictions, does not necessarily mean that the model reflects the actual contact scenario, and it is only finding spurious spatial correlations.</p>

            <title>5.7 Concluding remarks</title>
            <p id="S5.7">We have presented an overview of four distance metrics for typological research, two of which had not been computed before in a large scale. We show that it is in fact possible to compute topographic and walking distances for the worlds languages.</p>
            <p>The results in terms of predictive performance are less clear, however. For the Hindu-Kush dataset, the walking distances showed a clear advantage over the other distance metrics, and the topographic distance performed more or less at the same level as the geodesic distance, and the Euclidean distance performed worse of the four. However, for the European dataset, these results are reversed. Both the topographic and Euclidean distances performed considerably better than the walking distance and geodesic distance. Given the fact that the mapping system for Europe in OSM is more developed than for the Hindu-Kush area, we expected the results to be the other way around.</p>
            <p>One possible explanation for our results is that walking distances are not very accurate representations of the spatial separation of populations very far apart. Additionally, the Hindu-Kush data has relatively good point accuracy of the location of the languages in questions, while the European data uses very rough approximations. These two factors could be causing the walking distances to perform poorly.</p>
            <p>For the South American dataset the results are somewhat more difficult to interpret. It is possible that modern roads and paths are a poor representation of migration paths and trade routes for the languages of the continent. Alternatively, it might just be that our route information for the region is suboptimal.</p>
            <p>Overall, we can say for certain that the choice of distance metric can have a very large impact on the models. For some features, we saw upwards of 10% difference between the best and worse distance metric (e.g. Zero Copula for Predicate Nominals in the Hindu-Kush dataset). However, we cannot know a-priori which distance metric will better capture spatial patterns in any one case. From the four distances, the topographic and geodesic distances showed the most consistent performance across datasets, and would be likely to be reasonable first choices. At the same time, in most cases, the Euclidean distances were not much worse than the other distances, and might be a good enough approximation in cases for which performance is critical, or the dataset cover very large areas, and the point-location information is not very precise.</p>

                    <sup>10</sup>There is an important caveat to our modelling. Because of how the routing works, the walking distances do not necessarily satisfy the triangle inequality (in most cases by a couple of meters). The consequence of this is that the estimation of the parameters in the models is biased. Since for this paper we are only looking at predictive performance, this does not matter for our results. However, a researcher interested in understanding the actual spatial structures in the data should take extra care in fixing the distances.</p>

                    <sup>13</sup>A (computationally very costly) alternative would be to mix topographic and walking distances, faulting to topographic distances for cases in which there are no available roads for the walking distances. It is however not obvious how we could go about doing this, and we leave this question open for future research.</p>

            <p>This paper explores different methods measuring geographic distances, calculates these distances for all pairs of languages at a global scale, and tests their correlation with linguistic features. It provides a valuable resource for the researchers in linguistic and cultural evolution, and discusses which of these definitions are more suitable for studying different geographic areas and linguistic features.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> I think this is an interesting study which should be indexed after considering the following comments.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> 
                <bold>Major comments</bold>

            <p> 
                <underline>1 - Euclidean distance</underline>
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> I do not understand why Euclidean distance is considered here, at least with the current definition. I would understand Euclidean distance as a rectangular distance on a plane, where both coordinates (x,y) are defined in the same units. On a spherical surface, the closest equivalent to Euclidean would be geodesic/great-circle distance. Calculating distances like in Eq. (1), just as the squared sum of latitude and longitude in degrees, treating them as distances, is simply wrong. I understand that this calculation is computationally non-intensive, but so is geodesic distance, and much more exact.&#x00a0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Euclidean distance as defined here can be useful at relatively short scales, especially near the equator (and it is used in this way inside each area studied in the present paper, except for Northern Europe), but there should be at least some approximation such as the haversine formula, or UTM projection, as mentioned in Footnote 4.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> I disagree with the first statement in the sentence &#x201c;Euclidean distances assume that the earth is flat, and geodesic distances assume that the surface of the earth is a smooth sphere.&#x201d; for Euclidean distance as defined in Eq. (1) does not (only?) assume a flat surface of the earth, but a deformed one, where the E-W extension of Greenland at its maximum, from Etah at (long = -72&#x00b0;, lat = +78&#x00b0; ) to Danmarkshavn (long = -18&#x00b0;, lat = +77&#x00b0;) is larger than the maximal E-W extension of South America, from Piura in Peru (long = -80&#x00b0;, lat = -5&#x00b0;) to Natal in Brazil &#x00a0;(long = -35&#x00b0;, lat = -5&#x00b0;), while the first is 1,300km (54&#x00b0;) and the second one 5,000km (45&#x00b0;).</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The authors acknowledge this fact&#x02d0; &#x201c;However, for larger distances, and distance far away from the Equator, Euclidean distance can produce results which are very different from actual distances along the surface of the Earth.&#x201d;, but still use these metrics.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The authors mention 4 references, two using either Euclidean or geodesic distances, and then two more using Euclidean distances either explicitly or implicitly. The first two do not use Euclidean distance as far as I understand. Murawaki and Yamauchi (2018) mentions&#x02d0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> 
                <italic>&#x201c;Languages were found to be associated with single-point geographical coordinates (longitude and latitude), as shown in Fig. 1. We constructed a spatial neighbor graph by linking all language pairs that were located within a distance of R km.&#x201d; &#x00a0;</italic>
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Which I understand as geodesic distances, since these are measured in km.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> In Ranacher et al (2021):</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> 
                <italic>&#x201c;Distance is modelled as a cost function C, which assigns a non-negative value ci,j to each pair of locations i and j. Costs can be expressed by the Euclidean distance, great-circle distance, hiking effort, travel times, or any other meaningful property quantifying the effort to traverse geographical space.&#x201d;</italic>
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> It is not clear to me what they mean by Euclidean distance here, but could not find this used as in Eq.(1) in the further calculation of costs.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> As for the other references, it is true that Guzm&#x00e1;n Naranjo and Becker (2021) use it, although pointing out that this is a simplification:</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> 
                <italic>&#x201c;For simplicity, we use Euclidean distances between languages. This is, of course, a simplification. It would be fairly easy to use other distance metrics with a GP, e.g. geodesic distances or walking distances (Wichmann and Hammarstr&#x00f6;m 2020).&#x201d;</italic>
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Finally, in Verkerk and Di Garbo (2022), I do not see this so clearly. Latitude and longitude are used as independent predictors (one would expect that latitude is more determinant for it is more directly related with temperature differences), e.g.&#x02d0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> 
                <italic>&#x201c;The languages with the four different types of gender system differ in their mapping onto these four nonlinguistic variables, with the differences between types being larger for longitude and current forest overlap, and smaller for number of L1 speakers and latitude.&#x201d;</italic>
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> In addition, these measures are used in the African continent, which is relatively close to the equator.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> 2 - Cross-comparison of case-studies</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> I understand that the data available is not completely homogeneous for different areas, but I find it confusing that different linguistic measures are used in the different geographic areas&#x02d0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> 
                <italic>&#x201c;In terms of types of linguistic features, the Hindu-Kush data combines phonology, lexical and syntactic features; the South America data exclusively comprises word order features; and the European data is made up of phoneme inventories.&#x201d;&#x00a0;</italic>
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> I do not see why these different features would be expected to behave in the same way. If there are divergences from the expected correlations with geographic distance, is this because of the topography of the region or because the features studied are affected to a greater/lesser extent by language contact? It would be interesting to test at least one group of features in all 3 geographic scenarios, or split the features in a comparable way (e.g. those in the Hindu-Kush into phonological, lexical and syntactic, to check which ones are more affected by contact).</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> More generally, the use of vocabulary like &#x201c;...topographic distance tends to 
                <italic>outperform</italic>&#x00a0;the other distance metrics&#x2026;&#x201d; gives the idea of one distance being &#x201c;better&#x201d; than others in general. It should be clear in the writing that this outperformance is always a correlation with linguistic features, assuming that shorter geographic distances (in any of its flavors) is responsible for higher similarity among these features among languages.</p>

            <p> 3 - Report of main results</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> I do not agree with statements such as (Abstract)&#x02d0;</p>
            <p> 
                <italic>&#x201c;We evaluate these distance metrics on three case studies and show that topographic distance tends to outperform the other distance metrics, but geodesic distances can be used as an adequate approximation in some cases.&#x201d;</italic>
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Or, more specific outputs for each case study such as&#x02d0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> 
                <italic>&#x201c;For the Hindu-Kush dataset, the walking distances showed a clear advantage over the other distance metrics&#x2026;&#x201d;&#x00a0;</italic>
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> This is not so clear to me from Table 1. It seems to have performed as well as topographic and geodesic distances.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> 
                <italic>&#x201c;However, for the European dataset, these results are reversed. Both the topographic and Euclidean distances performed considerably better than the walking distance and geodesic distance.&#x201d;&#x00a0;</italic>
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> This is also not clear from Table 2. Geodesic distances perform clearly better than the other 3, which perform approximately equally in all 3 metrics.</p>

            <p> </p>
            <p> Numbering of sections: this is a little confusing along the paper. All sections start with the number 5: 5.1, 5.2,... Unless this is the fifth chapter of a collection, please correct. At the end of the paper, Sections 6-8 appear for Data and Software availability, Author contributions, and Acknowledgments respectively.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> As for the subsections (sections after the 5.), it seems that some of them are incorrectly labeled. For example, at the end of the Introduction, Sections 5.2, 5.4, and 5.7 are mentioned only, while all should be referred: 5.3 is Materials and methods, and I believe 5.4-5.6 should be sub-sections of the same section (Case studies 1, 2, and 3).</p>

            <p> The coloured dots are not easily readable in the current format. Even in Fig 9, where there are few features in the y-axis, the jittering applied does not help to understand which dot belongs to each feature. I suggest trying a different visualization, e.g. horizontal lines matching all 4 dots for each feature, and different icon shapes for these 4 dots (the colors can be kept besides the shapes). Also, reordering the y-axis by their value in the x-axis (see next item) can help in cases such as Fig 7, with a great proportion of dots on the x=0.5 line.</p>

            <p> Features in each case are ordered in (inverse) alphabetical order. It might be easier to read if they were ordered differently, either by (average? minimum?) value of accuracy, or by some meaningful grouping (e.g. phoneme types in Fig 7).</p>

                <bold>Summary and general comments</bold>
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> This paper introduces two novel techniques for computing distances between languages. The two distance metrics created through these techniques are a measure of topographic distance and one of walking distance between language communities. The paper illustrates the technical implementation of the two measures and shows how they can be used to study linguistic areality and contact effects from a typological perspective. The accuracy of the two metrics is compared against two distance metrics previously used in typological studies of language contact: Euclidean distance and geodesic distance. The four metrics are applied to three existing typological databases, each focusing on linguistic features of three established linguistic areas: the Hindu-Kush, Europe, and South America. The studies show that the choice of distance metric can significantly affect the type of generalizations that be drawn from a model, and that it is hard to establish a priori which measure would work best to capture areality effects in a given dataset. The results presented in the paper suggest that, in general, topographic and geodesic distance perform most consistently across the three datasets.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The paper makes an important methodological contribution to the study of spatial effects on the distribution of linguistic diversity. Firstly, because it enriches the range of methods typologists can use to control for areal biases in the distribution of structural properties of languages. Secondly, because the method offers a promising new way to account for areality bottom-up. This is especially crucial not only for the purpose of bias control, but also for detecting linguistic areas and/or areality effects in an exploratory fashion, for instance by testing hypotheses about the areal spread of given linguistic phenomena independently of pre-established areal groupings.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> I would encourage the authors to develop a bit more on this second point, which does not emerge so neatly from the current version of the text, but, which, I believe, is of great potential for linguistic typology. Have the authors thought, for instance, about applying their new measures to the newly published 
                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://grambank.clld.org/">Grambank dataset</ext-link>?&#x00a0;This newly released database, the largest worldwide typological database to date, could offer an important test ground to further test the validity of the two distance metrics and, more generally, to detect areality effects bottom-up.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> In addition to the above-mentioned suggestion, I have a number of more minor comments and suggestions of revision, which are highlighted below.</p>

                <italic>"We evaluate these distance metrics on three case studies and show&#x00a0;</italic>

            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> This passage can be a bit misleading (when compared to the rest of the paper). It seems to imply that topographic distance is consistently better than the other three measures, while, in fact, depending on the model and the phenomena at stake, things can vary. I would suggest the authors to rephrase this passage by framing things in line with what stated in the concluding section (cf. 
                <italic>From the four distances, the&#x00a0;</italic>
                <italic>topographic and geodesic distances showed the most consistent&#x00a0;</italic>
                <italic>performance across datasets, and would be likely to&#x00a0;</italic>
                <italic>be reasonable first choices. At the same time, in most cases,&#x00a0;</italic>
                <italic>the Euclidean distances were not much worse than the other distances, and might be a good enough approximation in cases&#x00a0;</italic>
                <italic>for which performance is critical, or the dataset cover very&#x00a0;</italic>
                <italic>large areas, and the point-location information is not very&#x00a0;</italic>

            <p>This paper introduces two new ways of computing between-languages distances and provides directly usable datasets for these (plus two &#x201c;older&#x201d; methods). Given the general importance of ways of quantifying space in many cross-linguistic (and, more generally, cross-cultural) studies, I think this is an important addition to the literature, especially given the massive computational resources needed to compute one of these new distances, resources that are now readily available to the &#x201c;average&#x201d; language scientist.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> However, I do have a few suggestions and questions that might help improve the paper. In their (approximate) order of appearance in the paper:</p>

                        <p>After having read the paper, I think the last sentence is a bit misleading, in that it is far from clear to me (and to the authors themselves, in fact) that &#x201c;topographic distance tends to outperform the other[s]&#x201d; in a meaningful and general way &#x2013; I think this should be toned down as the paper is not about results but about the method and the distance matrices IMHO.</p>

                        <p>Para &#x201c;However, even at a &#x2026;&#x201c; -&gt; I was wondering if this would not work as a general solution in that maybe one can consider overlapping neighborhoods of the points of interest, but of course defining these neighborhoods brings in assumptions about the relative costs of vertical vs horizontal displacements (see above), but I guess it would be something worth discussing in the paper (if not testing)?</p>

                        <p>could you also use symbols as well as colors? Highlight the 0.5 vertical line. Order the features in a meaningful way? Connect the same-color points by lines as well (resulting in an easier-to-follow &#x201c;profile&#x201d; but make it clear this does not imply any &#x201c;linkage&#x201d; between features). For the vertical jitter, either use the same jitter for all features and/or draw alternating colored bands by feature to make it clear which point belongs to each feature (now it is pretty hard to see, especially combined with the color scheme).</p>

(also, they look very similar to my eye &#x2013; some statistical tsting would be useful?)

                    <list-item>
                        <p>The right benchmark for these distances: I agree with the authors that this is not the point of this paper, but still choosing the right benchmark might make the difference between these two new distances being actively embraced by the community or lingering in the literature&#x2026; Given that *most* actual uses of distances is to *control for* (i.e., remove) contact, maybe this would be a more appropriate benchmark? Also, (balanced) accuracy might not be the best (or, at least, the only) quantification of success here, but instead some sort of formal model comparison as well? And, finally, looking at known linguistic areas (e.g., the Balkans, which has non-trivial topography) might help? These are just ideas (and half-digested at that), of course, but I think the authors might want to at least discuss them given the amount of work (and computational power) already expended on this project?</p>
