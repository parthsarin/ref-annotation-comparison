                <p>We contend that the harvest of marine resources has played a critical, but as yet underappreciated and poorly understood, role in global history. In a review of the field of marine environmental history and archaeology we conclude that while much progress has been made, especially in the last two decades, fundamental questions remain unanswered. In order to make full use of the rapid growth of Big Data and ongoing methodological breakthroughs there is a need for collaborative and comparative research. Such joint efforts on a global scale must be guided by a focus on common, simple yet challenging, questions. We propose a Human Oceans Past research agenda to call for multi- and trans-disciplinary archaeological, historical and palaeoenvironmental/palaeoecological research to investigate: (1) when and where marine exploitation was of significance to human society; (2) how selected major socio-economic, cultural, and environmental forces variously constrained and enabled marine exploitation; and (3) what were the consequences of marine resource exploitation for societal development? We contend that this agenda will lead to a fundamental revision in our understanding of the historical role of marine resources in the development of human societies.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>Historians have persistently undervalued past harvests of marine resources. Stories of fish as Lenten food, of whaling as a tragedy of the commons, or of fisheries as the nursery of seamen are sprinkled throughout general history books as tropes of little consequence. But what was the actual significance of marine resources to the human past? An abundant historical literature addresses single fisheries and hunts, but systematic comparative analyses are rare. Authoritative overviews such as the recent 
                <italic toggle="yes">Cambridge World History</italic> make no more than a passing reference to the importance of marine extractions.
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN1">1</xref>
                </sup> Archaeologists are appreciative of the role of marine life during the Paleo- and Mesolithic but after the Neolithic Revolution they too tend to focus on agricultural activities and societies. Exceptions are those that prove the rule.
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN2">2</xref>
                </sup> Maritime history might be expected to have paid more attention to marine life, but it is often written as a story of crossings &#x2013; getting people, ideas and things across a vast expanse of sea &#x2013; and marine animals and habitats are lost from sight. A considerable literature focuses on human points of contact with land during marine exploitation; that is, the points of departure and arrival, cultural encounters, and maritime empires.
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN3">3</xref>
                </sup> But the many dimensions of what occurred during fishing, hunting, and travel, including human-animal interactions and the acquisition of new and transformational knowledge about marine ecosystems and resources, are less well researched.
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN4">4</xref>
                </sup>
            </p>
            <p>One reason for this oversight is perhaps a lack of readily available data, particularly when referring to long term trends and narratives of change. In the 
                <italic toggle="yes">Cambridge Economic History of Europe</italic>, Michell observed that &#x201c;One reason why the definitive history of European fishing has yet to be written is that quantitative records concerning fishing pre-1750 are few&#x201d;.
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN5">5</xref>
                </sup> Another factor may be methodological deficiencies that have encumbered the interpretation of information. However, the present ocean crisis - compounded by climate change, continuing heavy extraction, pollution of many forms (from noise to chemical), and more - has generated strong interest in the marine past to better assess its present and future. Historians and archaeologists working with ecologists have begun to establish historical baselines and thresholds of biodiversity and abundance loss, as a vital context for conservation and management. The HMAP project, running from 2000 to 2010,
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN6">6</xref>
                </sup> was the first large-scale collaboration between historical disciplines and marine ecologists querying &#x201c;what used to live in the oceans
                <italic toggle="yes">&#x201d;</italic> and established the scale of extractions and changes to marine abundance for many species and regions, especially through the last two centuries. This research agenda continues and is evolving with the application of new methods and questions and a much deeper time horizon under the flag of the Oceans Past Initiative.
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN7">7</xref>
                </sup>
            </p>
            <p>Compared to the legacy of human impacts on the marine environment, much less attention has been paid to the human contexts and human consequences of past marine resource use. Research in this field, which can be fairly labelled marine environmental history (broadly defined to include archaeology and marine historical ecology)
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN8">8</xref>
                </sup> is still relatively undeveloped, even when compared to historical marine ecology.
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN9">9</xref>
                </sup> Fundamental questions such as the role of seafood for historical food security, demography, and health - not to mention trade and globalisation - cannot be reliably answered with present knowledge.
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN10">10</xref>
                </sup> Iberian, Latin-American and Southeast Asian scholars have been leaders in highlighting the gaps in our global knowledge

                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN11">11</xref>

                </sup> Studies of the social and environmental forces and imperatives that varyingly drove or constrained marine exploitation, as well as the wider implications of marine resource use for economic, social, and political developments,  consequently lack a solid underpinning.</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose a research agenda for the study of the importance of marine resources for the development of human societies in the last two millennia prior to industrialised fishing and whaling. While we recognize the importance of marine resources for earlier periods of human development, we concentrate on this period because of the relative abundance of evidence and the importance of the known marine events therein.</p>
            <sec>
                <title>The abundance of evidence for oceans past</title>
                <p>It can be imagined that the sea washes away all traces of the past &#x2013; that the history of human interaction with marine life cannot be written because of the lack of documentary and material evidence. In fact, evidence is abundant when we look with determination. It is true that material evidence for the long history of humans and the sea must be wrested from an increasingly vulnerable evidence base, impacted by sea level rise, erosion and the melting of permafrost, thereby adding urgency to the questions we ask and highlighting the short (but for the moment still open) window of access to a wealth of archaeological material that may soon be lost.

                    </sup> Primary documentary and visual sources may also be gathered from regional and national archives, ranging from folklore and oral histories to general and natural histories, logbooks and journals, leaflets and newspapers, laws, tithes and taxes, cargo lists, import/export and fishing statistics to maps, illustrations, paintings and many different kinds of imagery.

                </p>
                <p>An example of this potential is the hunt for Arctic sea mammals. This is a history that may be thought well-known as a relentless story of a hunting down toward extirpation or near extinction until the commercial whaling moratorium of 1985.
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN15">15</xref>
                    </sup> However, abundant evidence that may modify and add cultural specificity has not yet been fully analysed and we are bound to be in for surprises. Archival data have revealed unanticipated knowledge  - such as the provision of much of Britain&#x2019;s 18th-century baleen by Inuit of southern Baffin Island, Canada.
                    <sup>

                    </sup> Yet many research opportunities, especially for large-scale analyses, are only newly possible and remain to be realised. Adding to previous knowledge of British and American whaling in the age of sail,
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN17">17</xref>

                    <sup>

                    </sup> This database includes detailed information about whaling processes, whaling ground locations, the effort expended to hunt these leviathans, and the human cost in actual lives. Further documentary and visual sources may inform of practices and the processes of knowledge accumulation (
                    <italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic>, by trial-and-error) and appropriation (

                <p>A global research agenda for marine environmental history should uncover the rich and varied pathways - enabling and constraining forces and motivations, from knowledge and ideologies to demographics and environmental variability - that underlay strategies of oceanic resource use and non-use. It should also examine if, when and how barriers of knowledge, technology, and culture were overcome and with what consequences for societies and the environment. We contend that human societies diverged in their awareness and uses of marine wealth through time. Periodic &#x201c;discoveries&#x201d; or developing appreciation of these resources represented injections of novel wealth that potentially helped societies escape food shortages, triggered long-term socio-economic (including demographic) consequences and ecological impacts, while other societies did not apparently embark on any significant marine resource use, or incurred costs and derived benefits that were markedly unequally distributed by class, gender and more. Where they were drawn upon, marine resources were socially metabolised, i.e. valued, consumed, and energetically transformed for food, clothes, energy, health, adornment and more. In these diverse ways they played a significant yet - we contend - underappreciated role for trajectories of human demography, wealth and culture.</p>

However, these studies are based on highly aggregated data of limited time-depth. The baseline study of the &#x2018;Bounty of the Sea&#x2019; index employs FAO statistics of 1950, which are skewed towards industrialised regions. Nevertheless, the findings raise interesting questions about global historical development, which must also be set within the context of long-term negative feedbacks of industrialisation, not least for oceans.

We believe that a global agenda will help focus the emerging field of marine environmental history around a set of bold but simple research questions that may be answered by pooling data and methods from a diverse range of historically minded disciplines, including archaeology, anthropology, ecology, geography, history, paleo-oceanography and many more.</p>

                <p>3 - What were the consequences of marine exploitation for societal development and the oceans?</p>

                <p>We may indicate the implications of this negligence by an example. Thirty years ago, D. B. Quinn, the historian of European Atlantic voyages of discovery, remarked that &#x201c;Newfoundland, - the fish of the Banks, the inshore cod fishery, the whale fishery on its northern flank - may in the end prove to have been for Europe during the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries as valuable a discovery as the gold and silver of the Spanish empire.&#x201d;

Quinn&#x2019;s speculation gained little traction with historians, although Peter Pope later noted that the number of seamen involved in the fisheries far exceeded those in the Spanish silver convoys.

The conquest of the Spanish Indies is dramatic and colourful, was written about extensively at the time and ever since, while Newfoundland and its produce has remained, relatively, a backwater in world history, something to be taken for granted perhaps, but not assessed as being in any way of major significance for European development as a whole.&#x201d; As Quinn suggests, the reasons for this neglect by historians may be found in the glimmer of silver and gold.</p>
                <p>More fundamentally, however, the NorFish project identified problems of data abundance and methodology. An assessment of the scale of the fisheries demanded that the sheer wealth of documentation preserved in the French notarial archives be overcome, and strategies devised to compare these findings with the English navy records of fisheries in 120 locations. Archival studies, data curation and the development of analytical tools took several years and would have been inconceivable without large-scale funding. The result was a fundamental revision of estimated catch volumes. Historians and biologists, building on older research, have taken for granted that Newfoundland and Grand Banks catches were in the order of 200,000 metric tonnes through the early modern period.

                <p>Similarly, the significant early (10th to 13th century CE) ecological and socio-economic impact of marine resource extraction in Europe (fishing) and the Arctic (walrus hunting), created considerable (if sometimes short-term) wealth by capitalising upon and sometimes notably diminishing animal populations.

What factors, then, have driven, constrained and enabled marine exploitation? This is a complex question that is often left unanswered or contingent upon the preference (and disciplinary background) of the inquirer. While some see human exploitation of the sea as largely dependent on key variables such as proximity and regional variation in natural abundance, others see human agency as the primary driver. A key challenge is therefore to untangle questions of causation that until now have seemed unsolvable. The Human Oceans Past agenda may consider this problem by breaking it down into questions of knowledge, drivers, and consumption preferences.</p>

In every river and coastal area of Central and South America, manatees (also known as sea cows or ox-fish) have historically been used as a valuable resource by indigenous populations. They were caught by harpoons, nets, ropes, traps and even remoras (&#x201c;fishing fish&#x201d;), depending on the geographic region and the Indigenous community, and probably also according to the habitat and size of each individual. In some societies, women (as partners to the fishermen) were a vital element of the search and hunt for the animals, taking an active role in all the processes, not just in the butchering and distribution of the parts. The arrival of the first Europeans to the islands and coasts of the Americas intensified the impact of human populations on these animals. It also reinforced the European understanding of aquatic bodies as a birthplace of life, diversity and abundance; even more so in these lands, where this abundance was apparently endless.

The Human Oceans Past agenda should contribute to placing the animals (as resources and as symbols) and their ecosystem at the centre of the discussion about the environmental and sociocultural contexts and interactions of societies in pre-modern contexts.

This occurred at least partly as a consequence of terrestrial crop failures and incipient famine that pressed fishers, already faced with insufficient alewife runs, to heavily exploit the mackerel population that seasonally migrated into the region (both species having already been adversely affected by the volcanically induced colder waters). This shift to greater exploitation of mackerel and away from the alewife persisted, moreover, despite the recovery of alewife populations and terrestrial agriculture in the following years. Human response to this singular extreme climatic event can thus be credited with a long-term alteration to this ecosystem and its human entanglements.

                <p>There are great methodological challenges to studying consumption history both as regards the archaeological and documentary evidence. As introduced above, for example, it is often assumed that European medieval fish consumption was partly determined by Catholic prescriptions of Lent &#x2013; and conversely that early modern Northern Europe saw a religiously driven decline in seafood consumption. Recent empirical studies have questioned this widespread hypothesis. Western European annual per capita consumption of cod and herring increased by 50% between 1525 and 1625.

                    </sup> Consumption decreased during the 17th-century military and climate crisis but increased again through the 18th century when long-distance cod fisheries boomed. This trajectory indicates that the growth of the Grand Banks and Newfoundland fishery may have played a significant role in human demographic growth by providing increased food security during the early modern period - and that assumptions about the dietary effect of the Protestant Reformation need to be revisited.</p>
                <p>Archaeology, which revealed the FEH, is unfortunately less helpful for now as regards early modern seafood consumption. Post-medieval zooarchaeological evidence has suffered from the impacts of emerging civic refuse disposal practices in the past, and both limited research interest and the disturbance of recent archaeological strata by modern development in the present.

Northeast Atlantic right whales were the main target of whaling at least since medieval times in the Basque Country and probably also in Portugal. Their continued and well-organised hunt put unprecedented pressure on natural populations of migrating mothers and calves and, as importantly, influenced the transfer of practices from medieval Europe to the early modern colonial settlements of North and South America.

How much represented local resources, versus fish from further afield, including transoceanic? How much of the fish was fresh (always much more expensive) and how much was dried/salted? The answers will reveal changes in consumption, logistics and profits and provide the basis for wider analyses of pre-modern perceptions of the natural world.

            <p>We contend that the role of marine resources has been systematically underestimated in a historiography that has (by relative weight of publications) focused on terrestrial resources. The long-term development and relative success of marine resource use depended on how societies came to know of these resources and overcome the many technological, environmental, and cultural obstacles to their access, including the potential opportunity costs of pursuing marine resources relative to terrestrial resources. In effect, how marine resources were socially metabolised to become marine wealth. Societies consumed, traded, and energetically transformed marine resources for food, clothes, energy, health and adornment, in diverse ways that have played a significant role for trajectories of human demography, wealth and culture. Geographical, technological, economic and cultural pathways conditioned societies in distinct ways and could create deep linkages between coast and hinterland.

            <p>Marine wealth was probably much more widely distributed than land wealth. While agricultural estates and mineral wealth tended towards a concentration in the hands of an elite and left conspicuous testimony of consumption, marine wealth was likely to be distributed in a wide network of middling merchants and investors. One reason for the conspicuousness of mineral wealth such as that from the Latin American silver mines may be that the riches of the mines were concentrated in the hands of an elite who sponsored magnificent art and architecture, whereas the wealth of the fishery was more widely distributed among many agents, from fishermen to merchants to financiers. The wider distribution of wealth in the fisheries has given rise to conflicting theories of egalitarian social fabrics of fishing communities.

                </sup> How these communities responded to the potential for sudden peaks and troughs in marine resource availability also remains an important question. The impacts of such "cyclonic volatility" in natural resource abundance could be profound, with historical cases such as the Bohusl&#x00e4;n phenomena providing valuable case-studies of societal adaptation and resilience, and relatedly who ultimately benefitted from natural resources.

In many other cases, sirenians, turtles, sharks, seals, walruses, different species of fish, and other marine living resources were the centre of appropriation, contacts or conflicts, in short, of historical entanglements between humans and the ocean.</p>
            <p>In sum, we propose the Human Oceans Past agenda to encourage scholars of all fields to address a set of simple but essential questions that will enhance our understanding of how marine extraction drove (and was in turn driven by) global economic and ecological change, while also playing a major role in politics and societies. To make decisive advances forward in understanding the role of the sea in human societies we need a definitive methodological step change in the integration of humanities and natural science. Pursuing the Human Oceans Past agenda will require such an integration as well as introduce much-needed chronological depth that can better address the urgent and interlinked societal and environmental issues faced across the globe, through the understanding of past commonalities and divergences in the use and perceptions of the oceans.</p>

        <body>
            <p>Reading this magnificent text, one understands even more the urgency of a global research agenda on oceans and seas as an answer to the questions that assail us from the urgency of the environmental and climate crisis. It is a text of a high level of reflection, which allows us to understand the paths travelled for marine research, indicates the points to be completed in the future and provides us with reflections for the future. Scientific soundness, interdisciplinary dialogues and a systematisation of the work towards the future run through the pages of the article with enormous validity. Therefore, with this quality of research, my comments only make sense as proposals for dialogue and collaboration with the authors. They are only reflections born of the interesting elements that are proposed in the text, answers that I also seek in my own research.&#x00a0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Environmental historians, with a strong focus on land, agrarian and peasant historians, have much to learn from the challenges presented in this magnificent article.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> 
                <bold>Methodological Challenges.</bold>
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> In this first section I will express ideas and proposals arising from the methodological profiles proposed in the text.&#x00a0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> 
                <italic>Supporting a Non-Human-Centric Matrix</italic>
                <italic>.</italic>
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The first of these stems from interdisciplinarity, which is present in the text in all its aspects, but which may have more possible tools. From the field of environmental history in which some of us move, the links with archaeology and history have been and are constants in our daily work. This dialogue is very much embedded in the narrative of the text but it would be good to reinforce the dialogues from Environmental History, the processes of historical co-evolution as opposed to social and environmental determinisms, making the historical processes from the Modern Age to the present more complex. To this end, the text invites us to continue with the History of Animals, of Non-Human Beings in our agenda, which many of us should implement in our research.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> 
                <italic>Contributions to a Non-Eurocentric Matrix and Communality</italic>
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> A second challenge is the Eurocentric rupture of the text, a logical consequence of the projects that contribute to it. There are many research experiences that we have developed in many other oceans that are not coeval with the logics described in the text, nor do they have the same timelines (in our work in the Pacific Ocean, Baja California Sur, the transition from hunter-gatherers to ocean commodification occurred between 1700 and 1830), nor similar logics of appropriation of goods. We know about this proposal of the authors and it is described in a few paragraphs, but to understand even more about the Oceans we need to look very broadly at the Global South. We are developing projects on shark consumption in Reunion Island, or the difficulty around loggerhead turtle consumption or totoaba in Mexico are just some of the tasks we are engaged in in many places that can bring knowledge to this agenda.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Linked to this debate, the reflection on the Global Commons applied to marine and oceanic resources, pushes us to reflect on the forms of communality that have survived throughout history, parallel to the implementation of a "capitalisation of Nature" since the mid-18th century. This could be a very fertile field for pooling research on a global scale.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> This openness to research in non-European territories, which in many cases is carried out by researchers from European institutions in addition to our projects in Europe, could allow us to design a greater and better response to global challenges in socio-environmental research on the oceans, given the interaction between many of the processes of change in the management of natural assets.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> How can we create such common global agendas?</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> 
                <italic>Contributions to a Quantitative Research Matrix</italic>
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> In addition to the above, the authors point out very well the limitations to go beyond the Baselines before 1950-60, following FAO statistics. It is true of the difficulty but we can collaborate between different disciplines to establish local projects in the oceans in order to - using the methodology of Material Energy Flow Accounts, MEFA - design local baselines with the use of historical material from archives and a central element, the memory of the inhabitants of the oceans, of the seas... the Biocultural Memory that allows the recovery of traditional knowledge and know-how of the coastal peoples.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> This assessment of territorial sustainability with a historical matrix can resolve this baseline limitation and provide valuable information with which to design a new communality as a social tool for the sustainability of the oceans and seas, with local knowledge.&#x00a0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> This can facilitate a methodological leap already mentioned, how to investigate, what archival materials we use, how we put into dialogue with tools of participatory and collaborative research, new research agendas in which archaeology, history and anthropology can give other possible results. This proposal may require "decolonising research processes", especially outside European contexts.&#x00a0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Can we design platforms of biophysical, social and emotional indicators, from interdisciplinary contributions, for the design of future sustainability tools and provide input to EU public policies?</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> 
                <bold>Proposals for new dialogues.</bold>
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> This magnificent text provides insights to new fields of research in the future, which emerge from the many already indicated in it and from some that are pointed out in it, and we can cite some ideas for the future.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> 
                <italic>Production</italic>
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Oceans are (fluid) territories with intense levels of disputes, of environmental conflicts arising from the well-described process of commodification of natural resources (Anthropocene vs. Capitalocene?). This view of the oceans as resource providers, subject to intense extraction processes, should not make us forget that they are avenues for the implementation of new forms of commodification in the Global South: Guano, salt, raw materials, mother-of-pearl and pearls, turtles, underwater mining... are just some of the examples of this old-new intensive exploitation of the seas as such and as "highways for great acceleration".&#x00a0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> 
                <italic>Consumption</italic>
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> If we can build historical baselines, pre 60's, it will be easy to establish laboratories in many ocean territories on changes in agri-food systems, changes in diets, changes in human consumption patterns on marine goods. This change in food systems must be connected to changes in agrarian patterns (working with MEFA tools may be easier to assess quantitatively and qualitatively) since for many peoples the agrarian and the marine are integral to consumption patterns.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Inequalities in consumption levels, the need for a new form of relationship and access to marine goods in the face of ecocide may allow for a new Political Ecology of the Oceans to be generated in which to integrate both social and environmental inequity and the socio-environmental tensions that occur around material hexaction.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Finally, congratulations to the text for the work, which is enormous and of the highest quality. But above all, congratulations for inviting us to think about our research proposals and to incorporate many of these proposals into projects. I am sure that many dialogues will arise in the future to share.</p>
            <p>Is the argument persuasive and supported by appropriate evidence?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Is the work clearly and cogently presented?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Is the topic of the essay discussed accurately in the context of the current literature?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Does the essay contribute to the cultural, historical, social understanding of the field?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Reviewer Expertise:</p>
            <p>Environmental History, Environmental Conflicts, Ocean History</p>
            <p>I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.</p>

            <p>This is a welcome, well-conceived and well-executed call to action on a problem which, as the authors correctly identify, has been badly under-appreciated and under-studied by historians. Given the aims of the essay &#x2013; to raise awareness of the problem and to lay out a potential line of research &#x2013; I think that it does not need serious revision and will make an important impact in its current state. The nature of their argument is spot-on, and they are correct to call out historians for ignoring the history of marine extraction (though I am already sympathetic on this point!). The comments and suggestions I offer are merely a matter of strengthening the case as it stands, and highlighting strengths and concerns which I am sure the authors have already thought about but which stood out to me as a reader.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> An important contribution of this piece is to bring together and summarize several recent lines of research by different teams of historians and archaeologists in Europe .There is considerable value in just laying out the problem as it is now understood by fisheries historians and archaeologists. The notes are in and of themselves a major contribution to the scholarship, acting as a kind of ersatz bibliography of the latest research on marine environments and extraction. It is particularly striking that the authors range so broadly across time and space in the scholarship they bring together, in a way which is unusual and helpful for those wishing to begin research projects or teaching endeavors on the topic of marine history.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> A few thoughts: 
                <list list-type="order">
                    <list-item>
                        <p>It is not always clear what is the relationship between the call to action and specific projects with which the authors are affiliated. Is this meant to be the manifesto of the emerging 4Oceans project? A preliminary to a set of conferences and funded research? Or a more general, global plea for more research?</p>

                        <p>The long section entitled &#x201c;The driving forces of marine exploitation&#x201d; may be the best concise overview of the problem of human-marine extraction interactions yet written. I am probably going to reference this excellent summary in my own writing, and would be very interested in using it for teaching. I would suggest the authors consider foregrounding this section at the start of the article &#x2013; putting the broad overview before the breakdown of project and approach. It is a passionate, synthetic, and detailed explanation which I think would better frame the case this essay tries to make if placed further up.</p>

                        <p>I am very happy that the authors wish to understand the transition to fishing regimes, including in very early human history. It is not always clear, however, how far back they want to go &#x2013; much of the specific examples are from the past two millennia, and I wished for some clarification if they want to go all the way back to the early Holocene and the emergence of fishing/fisheries.</p>

                        <p>While the authors point to many potential lines of inquiry, research projects, and potential subjects, I do think it would be helpful to specify a few key sites/times/topics which could serve as a starting point. What are, perhaps, 4-5 crucial research sites and topics we need to know more about, and which could serve as an initial testing ground for the methods they are proposing? Coastal California, southeast Asian islands, coastal West Africa perhaps? I say this not to be pedantic, but to suggest that the call to action might be more manageable if it was a bit more specific (at least in the near-run). And given the expertise of the authors, I am genuinely curious as to what they see as those topics most in need of scholarly attention.</p>

                        <p>There is some scholarship on this problem from the US and Canada which is not cited, and which may be of use to the authors. It is less quantitative, but I think indicative of the newer research on marine extraction. I am here thinking of work by Jakobina Arch, Brian Paine, Bathsheba Demuth, Arianne Urus, Jack Bouchard, Elizabeth Mancke, etc.</p>

                        <p>On a personal note, I would say the early modern European extractive fisheries along the Saharan Coast of Africa (the Rio do Ouro and Arguim) are badly under-studied and would be a great case-study for this kind of research agenda.</p>

                </list> The following is not necessarily something the authors have to address in this piece, but reflects more of my general reaction to this essay: I have one overarching concern from which my other comments will follow. This is that the essay, as it currently stands, spends far more time laying out the problem than the solution. Much of the text is devoted to describing the importance of future fisheries research, and the benefits to be derived from this. The actual discussion of evidence, methods, and plans is much more brief. To put it another way, at the moment the essay is thought-provoking, but I am not sure it is 
                <italic>persuasive. </italic>It is a call to arms which gestures as potential futures, but does not always set out a practical roadmap. &#x00a0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> I have two interrelated comments/challenges for the authors: 
                <list list-type="order">
                    <list-item>
                        <p>I am not sure that the authors&#x2019; emphasis on a 
                            <italic>quantitative </italic>approach to premodern global extractive histories is realizable, nor does their discussion of evidence suggest that it will be easy, given the nature of the documentary and archaeological sources. I suspect they are equally interested in qualitative approaches, which may be our only options in some time/place settings, but that is not always made clear.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>I am concerned by the presumption that methods and theories developed largely in northern Europe to study premodern northern Atlantic and northern European marine ecosystems can, or should, be applied globally.</p>
                    </list-item>
                </list> Previous work on premodern fishing, which the authors draw heavily upon, has focused largely on northern Europe and the north Atlantic, with a particular emphasis on evidence from the British Isles, northern German, Scandinavia, and coastal France. They correctly point out that there has been a rising interest in research outside of the global north, but the substantive body of scholarship (especially quantitative) comes from the north. The essay points to work on the Fish Event Horizon (the North Sea zone), NorfFsh project (North Atlantic), Arctic Whaling (Spitsbergen, the Canadian Arctic, Terra Nova, Berengia, etc.), and coastal fisheries in the Baltic. The authors and project team are overwhelmingly scholars of northern Europe and the North Atlantic, and based primarily in the British Isles. (With the significant exception of Portuguese scholars in the project, which raises the question of why Iberian evidence/fishing histories aren&#x2019;t highlighted more in this project?)</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The section on evidence (pp.4-5) is only about three paragraphs long and, while it summarizes previous work and explains the importance of Big Data approaches, it does not actually address the nature of the global evidence for premodern marine extraction. The documentary evidence that would allow for quantitative approaches is often sparse to nonexistent even before 1600, even in Europe. The 16
                <sup>th</sup>-century data for the Newfoundland/Terra Nova cod fisheries, for instance, is very patchy before the 1580s (leading to an over-reliance on a few cities like Rouen, La Rochelle, and Bordeaux). They point to the success of whaling studies, but this only proves the problem I am trying to raise: that research was possible only because of the unusually rich documentary basis in northern European archives, the unusual investment in archaeology at places like Spitsbergen, and because historians have largely focused on the periods when documents become more available after the early 18
                <sup>th</sup> century.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> I am somewhat uneasy by the authors&#x2019; desire to apply the Fish Event Horizon model to the rest of the world, using the Marine Event Horizon model. This smacks of assuming a northern European phenomenon must be a global norm &#x2013; and a desire to go looking for it everywhere else on the planet. I am not persuaded that the MEH will actually prove to be a global norm, or that we should, in effect, go looking for North Seas everywhere else. I assume that is not their intention, but the essay gives this scant mention. I would like to see more discussion of how the authors intend to explore, refine, and accommodate alternative models and frameworks for understanding changing extractive regimes in a global context.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> To give a concrete example to this, on page 8 (of the pdf) the authors point to the potential to apply their methods to California&#x2019;s channel islands. I find that a very appealing prospect, but am not sure how it would be realized. How do we overcome the absence of archival sources, and rely solely on archaeology? Has there been sufficient archaeological work, and if not, how do we remedy that? Can we translate this into quantitative data? And if we go looking in California for a MEH, what do we do if we don&#x2019;t find it? I imagine the authors have answers to all these questions, and will no doubt address them in future work.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The authors gesture to a desire to expand their research towards the global south. I could not agree more, and I am delighted &#x2013; thrilled, even &#x2013; to see this as a core part of their research agenda. To me, nonetheless, this raises a few concerns: 
                <list list-type="order">
                    <list-item>
                        <p>The serious shortfall in archaeological work in many parts of the world, resulting from longstanding systemic biases against funding and organizing such efforts. This is obviously not the fault/problem of the authors, but it is a real stumbling block. There has been, for instance, much more archaeological work specifically focusing on marine extraction done around the North Sea basin than around, say, Chesapeake Bay, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, coastal Saharan Africa, the islands of the Indian Ocean, or the southern rim of the South China Sea. It&#x2019;s not clear if the authors want to fund/organize more global research, or if they mean to draw on what already exists? How do we work with and close this gap?</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>The archival gaps which may exist for such a quantitative study, or the potential for archival materials. The archaeological work on northern Europe shows one potential route around this, but has always been put in dialogue with documentary sources &#x2013; what do we do where we must rely solely on archaeological work? &#x00a0;</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>The language barriers this poses to a team based primarily in western/northern Europe &#x2013; how do we engage with scholarship and sources from beyond western archives? Should a new generation of fisheries historians be trained in non-European languages?</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>Is this is a call to get more scholars from the global south involved with maritime/fisheries history? (If so, what would that look like &#x2013; should there be more funded PhDs available to bring scholars from the global south to universities in Europe, the UK, and US/Canada?) Or is it a call for scholars from the global north to pay more attention to the global south? The latter seems to be the case, but perhaps it is time for the former?</p>
                    </list-item>
                </list> Again, I offer these thoughts not as a critique necessarily but as a set of ideas which the authors might want to mull over as the project moves forward. The piece is overall excellent, and I am happy to see it will soon be formally out in the world and open access.</p>
            <p>Is the argument persuasive and supported by appropriate evidence?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Is the work clearly and cogently presented?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Is the topic of the essay discussed accurately in the context of the current literature?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Does the essay contribute to the cultural, historical, social understanding of the field?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Reviewer Expertise:</p>
            <p>I research 15th-16th century Atlantic fisheries, especially Terra Nova/Newfoundland, and work on global premodern marine environments more generally</p>
            <p>I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.</p>
