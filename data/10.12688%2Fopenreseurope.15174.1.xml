                <p>Upgrading the level of smartness in buildings can significantly contribute to improve our quality and sustainability of living, through increased energy efficiency, optimised resource management, and improved air quality and comfort. However, the fragmented nature of the sector makes it challenging to identify what is technically, socially and economically achieved today in Europe in terms of building smartness, and what should be developed and financially supported tomorrow to accelerate the roll-out of smart and energy efficient buildings.</p>

                <p>This paper introduces the collaborative process developed to involve a large community of experts in detecting and formalising research and innovation gaps related to smart buildings. This process is composed of four successive steps: 1) a communication phase to invite volunteer experts to join the proposed task forces; 2) The organisation and facilitation of online brainstorming workshops to identify research &amp; innovation (R&amp;I) gaps; 3) the collective drafting of a white paper synthesising the brainstorming outcomes; and 4) an open consultation to collect additional external feedback before finalising the white paper.</p>

                <p>The collaborative process developed was tested over 18 months and implemented on 12 different topics relying on 27 brainstorming workshops. Building on the collective knowledge of 135 participants, it enabled identification a significant series of R&amp;I gaps related to smart buildings.</p>

                <p>The collective sessions as well as the open consultation phases showed overall some clear convergence on the gaps identified. It can therefore be concluded the outcome of the collaborative process reached a consensus among the targeted innovation community. The feedback collected on the process, shows that the frequency, duration and attendance of the brainstorming workshops proposed were very relevant, while the selection of online participatory tools could still be improved. This process could be replicated in other frameworks where research and innovation gaps are sought for.</p>

            <p>The deployment of smart building solutions throughout Europe faces some barriers and challenges, and the related innovation efforts need to be supported by the public authorities.</p>
            <p>This paper describes a collaborative design process implemented in 2021&#x2013;2022 to involve the European smart building community in identifying what type of research and innovation activities should be funded in the next years.</p>

            <p>The built environment impacts our lives in many ways: it influences our living, occupational or mobility behaviours, but also triggers significant environmental impacts, which in turn affect our health and wellbeing (

However, those ongoing efforts are very dispersed along the European construction value chain, due to the sector&#x2019;s fragmented structure, and diversity of trades involved in implementing and operating smart solutions in buildings

            <p>The SmartBuilt4EU project aims to consolidate the European innovation community in smart buildings in view of sharing good practices and formalising recommendations for further research and innovation.

                <title>Definition of smart building</title>
                <p>Building&#x2019;s smartness refers to the ability of a building or its systems to sense, interpret, communicate and actively respond in an efficient manner to changing conditions in relation the operation of technical building systems or the external environment and to demands from building occupants (

                <title>The SmartBuilt4EU project</title>
                <p>The SmartBuilt4EU project is an EC-funded project led by ECTP, the European Construction, built environment and energy efficient building Technology Platform. SmartBuilt4EU aims to foster collaboration between stakeholders of the smart building ecosystem, promote their innovations, and identify research and development (R&amp;D) gaps to support the further uptake of smart buildings. Two major outputs of the project are a strategic research and innovation agenda (SRIA) and a set of policy recommendations to foster the further deployment of smart solutions in the built environment. Those documents, to be published in March 2023, are elaborated based on a collaborative process enabling to gather inputs from diverse members of the smart building innovation community (SBIC), detailed hereafter.</p>

                <title>Objective and overall structure of the collaborative design process</title>
                <p>The objective of the collaborative design process developed within SmartBuilt4EU was to gather and formalise inputs from the smart building innovation community on the research and innovation needs that should be supported and financed by European public authorities in the coming years.</p>
                <p>The needs considered were organised in two categories in view of structuring the discussions with the community: &#x201c;R&amp;D gaps&#x201d; that include research, development, and demonstration activities; and &#x201c;go-to-market gaps&#x201d; covering standardisation, certification, industrialisation and upskilling needs, as well as regulatory evolutions.</p>
                <p>The participatory approach developed relies on two key components: the setup of four voluntary task forces, and a harmonised workflow for each task force to elaborate successive white papers during a limited time span (six months). Setting up four task forces enables to address four different dimensions of the smart buildings&#x2019; domain and gather participants around specific topics matching their own interest and expertise. The elaboration of white papers enables the authors to formalise the brainstorming outputs into a format that is directly exploitable for the construction of the final SRIA. Framing each white paper&#x2019;s work into a six-month period enables us to keep participants involved and motivated towards a short-term goal. The next sections introduce the four task forces and the different steps towards the white papers&#x2019; elaboration.</p>

                <title>The four task forces</title>
                <p>The participation to task forces is open to any stakeholder and on a voluntary basis. The four task forces respectively address distinct but complementary themes related to smart buildings. Their objective is to investigate three specific topics and produce a related white paper highlighting research and innovation gaps (R&amp;I gaps). This is performed in a sequential manner along three semesters. The respective themes of task forces were defined as follows:</p>

                        <label>-</label>
                        <p>based on this analysis, workshop 3 focuses on identifying the related R&amp;I gaps.</p>
                    </list-item>
                </list>
                <p>Each workshop has a duration of approximately 90 minutes. To structure the discussions and outputs, the brainstorming sessions are broken down into short successive time slots. For instance, barriers and drivers are categorised into &#x2018;value chain&#x2019;, &#x2018;social&#x2019;, &#x2018;technical&#x2019;, &#x2018;economic and financial&#x2019;, and &#x2018;legal and regulatory&#x2019;: a dedicated 5&#x2013;10 minute brainstorming timeslot is allocated to each category.</p>
                <p>In an equivalent process, the brainstorming about R&amp;I gaps is broken down into &#x2018;R&amp;D&#x2019;, &#x2018;demonstration&#x2019;, &#x2018;scaling up and industrialisation&#x2019;, &#x2018;standardisation/certification&#x2019;, and &#x2018;regulation&#x2019; categories, with successive timeslots. Once all categories are addressed, the facilitator proposes to cluster the different inputs provided into key ideas, that are submitted to a vote. This enables to highlight which gaps are considered as priorities by participants.</p>
                <p>The ConceptBoard, the online participatory tool to collect written contributions from participants, was structured according to the categories listed above.
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1"> Figure 1</xref> shows a concept board used to identify research &amp; innovation gaps for topic 1A. The orange and green tables on the left side (
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>) are respective reminders of the barriers and drivers identified during the previous brainstorming. The five columns in the blue frame reflect the 5 categories of R&amp;I gaps listed above. The colour notes are the inputs from participants. The blue rectangles cluster some inputs into common ideas. The small icons (thumb, heart, etc) represent the vote of participants of the ideas proposed.</p>

                <p>In step 3, the secretariat of each task force initiates a draft white paper formalising the brainstorming outputs. The document is then shared with task force members to collect additional feedback and inputs, in particular regarding lessons learnt from EU-funded projects. An internal review of all four white papers is finally performed by project partner VITO to check the coherence between white papers.</p>
                <p>In step 4, the draft white papers are released online and disseminated, together with an online questionnaire to collect feedback from stakeholders not directly involved in the task forces. Their feedback is then processed towards the finalisation of white papers.</p>

                <p>In addition to the collaborative workflow described above, a total of 33 EU-funded projects were invited to present their results, lessons learnt and good practices through webinars and workshops. Three webinars were co-hosted with Build Up from February 2021 to April 2022, one workshop was organised within the Sustainable Places 2022 conference in September 2022. These presentations, which were structured to encourage the exchange of real-life feedback from EU-funded projects, provided valuable inputs to the &#x201c;Lessons learnt&#x201d; sections in the white papers.</p>

            <p>The collaborative process developed by SmartBuilt4EU started at the end of February 2021 with an online workshop officially launching the task forces and attended by close to 50 participants from both industry and research. The first round of white papers was elaborated from February to September 2021, the second round from September 2021 to March 2022, and the third and final one from April to October 2022.</p>
            <sec sec-type="subjects">
                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>In total, 135 persons contributed to the twelve white papers produced, covering 23 European countries. Task force members feature a diversity of profiles: 45% come from public and private research organisations, 39% from business companies, 13% represent associations (European sector associations, national or regional associations or clusters) and 3% are certification or standardisation bodies. Many of them are involved in EU-funded projects (31 participating projects were referenced).</p>
                <p>An analysis of the participants of topic A of task force 1 (topic &#x2018;End user acceptance and attractiveness&#x2019;) showed that 64% were male and 36% female.</p>
                <p>With regard to the brainstorming workshops, the average level of participation was of 21 persons. For each topic, the first workshop (out of three) attracted the most people (28 in average), which can be explained by the fact that these &#x2018;topic launch&#x2019; workshops were more promoted than the following ones. The average participations in workshops 2 and 3 were respectively 19 and 18 attendees, showing a persistent interest from members. Participation was also relatively well spread between task forces, with averages ranging from 13 to 19 participants.</p>
                <p>Considering the open consultation process (step 4) very low feedback was observed, despite the significant communication actions undertaken. Seven answers were obtained on the first batch of white papers (topic A), two on the second batch and five on the third batch . Though it is difficult to explain the reasons of such low feedback, it can at least be concluded that engaging people was more efficient through online workshops than through an online questionnaire, no matter how brief and concise it was.</p>

                <title>Feedback from participants on the participatory process implemented</title>
                <p>On June 4th 2021, after the first series of workshops was conducted on topics A, an online questionnaire (Cl&#x00e9;mentine Coujard, 2022b) was proposed to participants during the last online session of task force 1 to collect feedback on the collaborative process implemented. The questionnaire was designed so that 1) it could be filled-in &#x2018;live&#x2019; in less than five minutes by participants; 2) participants would evaluate some specific aspects of the proposed workflow through multiple choice questions (about the frequency, duration and audience of the sessions, and the tools used); and 3) participants could add a free comment on how to improve the collaborative process.</p>
                <p>19 answers were collected (
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2">Coujard, 2022</xref>): this number cannot be considered as representative of the overall task force members, but it still gives some hints on how the approach was considered by the most active (and reactive) members. All respondents considered that the frequency of meetings was adequate (
                    <italic toggle="yes">i.e.</italic> &#x201c;just the right number of meetings&#x201d;). 18 respondents assessed the duration of meetings (1h30) as &#x201c;just the right duration&#x201d;, and one person considered it too short.</p>

The audience size was deemed adequate by almost all participants. A majority of respondents estimated that the audience profile and expertise was suited to the topic investigated.</p>
                <p>Regarding the tools used, a large majority of answers approved the use of the ConceptBoard and Sharepoint software used to brainstorm online and share the draft white paper document.</p>

                </fig>
                <p>The final and open question in the questionnaire was formulated as follows: &#x201c;How could we improve the recruitment/selection of participants, the interactivity of sessions, and the written contributions of participants?&#x201d;. Most answers dealt with the recruitment of participants and suggested to increase the communication efforts using social media, emailing, European clusters and platforms, and a project of publication as a motivational driver. Regarding the selection of experts, one respondent suggested to first draft the key ideas of each topic, as a driver to select adequate experts. We shall however recall that experts joined on a volunteer basis, according to their interest and knowledge on the topic, and willingness to invest a bit of time in this collaborative adventure &#x2013; therefore there was no &#x2018;selection&#x2019; 
                    <italic toggle="yes">per se</italic>. However, specifying each topic more precisely at the beginning of the process could indeed help experts better assess whether their expertise matches the topic.</p>

            <title>Conclusions</title>
            <p>The collaborative process developed was tested over 18 months and implemented on 12 different topics relying on 27 brainstorming workshops. Building on the collective knowledge and experience of 135 participants and at least 31 EU-funded projects, it enabled to identify a significant series of research &amp; innovation gaps related to smart buildings, that will next feed a strategic research and innovation agenda.</p>
            <p>One limitation can be observed in the process: as it relied on volunteering, there was no selection or evaluation of the participants&#x2019; expertise to contribute. However, the collective sessions showed overall some clear convergence on the gaps identified. The feedback from the open consultation phase, though limited, led to some additions in research and innovation gaps but did not question the ones proposed by the task force members. It can therefore be carefully concluded that the gaps identified reach a consensus among the targeted innovation community.</p>
            <p>The feedback collected on the process itself shows that the frequency, duration and attendance of the brainstorming workshops proposed were very relevant, while the selection of online participatory tools could still be improved.</p>
            <p>This process could be replicated in other frameworks where research and innovation gaps are sought for, such as EC-funded Coordination and Support Actions, as well as sectoral roadmaps.</p>

            <p>The manuscript titled &#x201c;Collaborative design approach to identify research and innovation needs within the European smart building community&#x201d;, identifies research and innovation gaps related to smart buildings. The article deals with an increasingly important issue of enhancing sustainability of buildings through different criteria such as energy efficiency and optimization of resource management.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The authors begin with emphasizing that, although several ongoing developments are dedicated to upgrading the intelligence of the buildings, however, the ongoing efforts are dispersed. This paper adds value to the literature by sharing an overview of what is achieved today in Europe and highlighting research and innovation gaps which should be dealt with in future. The authors applied a collaborative design approach, comprising gathering maximum stake-holders, 3 brainstorming workshops, drafting white papers and collecting feedbacks on them. 12 different topics were implemented in frame of workshops and 135 people participated who were mostly experienced with EU-funded projects. I would recommend the authors to enhance the quality of Figure 1 to better demonstrate the details of the applied methodology. Nevertheless, the paper well presents the statistical analysis derived from the feedbacks of participants. The work is an outcome of SmartBuilts4EU project and would be interesting for the addresees of Open Research Europe publications.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Here are my minor editorial recommendations for the authors to increase the quality of the paper:

            <p>This is a very well-written article that uses a collaborative design approach (many interactive workshops) to identify current R&amp;D gaps and innovation needs to support the acceleration of smart and energy-efficient buildings in Europe (in particular) from a user centric perspective.</p>
            <p> It clearly defines key barriers, challenges, and uses an interactive approach to overcome these.&#x00a0;</p>
            <p> The results and findings are based on 12 white papers prepared through the active participation and discussion of 135 participants across 23 European countries. Results and findings of 30+ relevant EU projects&#x00a0;were also considered.</p>
            <p>Is the study design appropriate and does the work have academic merit?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
