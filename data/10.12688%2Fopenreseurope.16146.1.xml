                <p>Sexual health has been recognized as an essential component of overall health and wellbeing. The current article aims, first, to review the current state of sexual health education in undergraduate medical curricula, identifying gaps, needs and challenges.</p>
                <p>The main part of this paper describes the development and content of an undergraduate sexual medicine curriculum based on a clear concept of the competencies, students should learn regarding knowledge, skills and attitudes.</p>
                <p>The content is based on a biopsychosocial understanding of human sexuality elaborated by international experts from different European countries integrating basic knowledge in biology, psychology, sociocultural and political sciences, preventive medicine, and the various therapeutic approaches to help women, men and couples with sexual health problems on a primary care level. In order to enable students to learn the basic skills of sexual history taking and basic sexual counselling two educational videos were produced.</p>
                <p>The material presented is part of the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) supported project European Sexual Medicine Network (ESMN). The material provided can serve universities to give the training as a 25&#x2013;30 hours course equivalent to 1 ECTS.</p>

            <p>The present article aims to describe the process that led to the development of a novel sexual medicine curriculum for undergraduate students. This curriculum was created throughout 4 years by a working group of international experts under the network association nominated European Sexual Medicine Network (ESMN)

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1">1</xref>
                </sup>, which is an European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) Action (CA18124).</p>
            <p>The working group had the following tasks</p>

                </list-item>
            </list>
            <p>As discussed in section 3 and 4, the rationale at the foundation of this effort lies in the current lack of effective and inclusive sexual health education in undergraduate, first level educational curricula of European universities. The discussion builds up on the current fragmented state of education and the resulting lack of expertise for healthcare professionals in addressing sexual health issues with patients. It follows with an overview of the challenges that may hinder the development and implementation of a comprehensive sexual medicine curriculum. </p>
            <p>To fill these gaps and harmonize basic university training in sexual health and sexual medicine, the COST Action European Sexual Medicine Network established a working group to elaborate a model curriculum in sexual medicine for undergraduate education in Europe. This working group consisted of experts representing different disciplines and fields involved in sexual medicine and sexual health care and different regions in Europe and beyond (see Acknowledgments). </p>
            <p>	The results of this shared effort are described in the main part of the final section of this article.</p>

            <title>Methods</title>
            <p>For task 1 and 2 an extensive search of all materials related to the topic was carried out in the PubMed and Google Scholar search engines. Relevant research articles focusing on sexual health education in undergraduate medical education published in the period 2006&#x2013;2023 were included in the review. Relevant articles were selected based upon relevance with the current review objectives and analyzed. Keywords used in the search included sexual health, medical education and curriculum (namely sexual health AND medical education; sexual health AND undergraduate medical education; sexual health AND curriculum). The articles published only in the English language were included for the current review. The collected information is presented in the following two sections.</p>
            <p>For tasks 3 and 4 the working group consisting of sexual medicine experts in the field of gynecology, urology, social science, public health, preventive medicine, internal medicine and endocrinology from different European countries had in person and virtual meetings which followed a modified Delphi procedure to achieve consensus
                <sup>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2">2</xref>
                </sup>.</p>
            <p>For all steps described below the chair and vice chair summarized discussions and inputs coming from the experts, sent the material back to the group members to get feedback and corrections which were then integrated and sent back to the group members for evaluation and feedback. Where necessary this procedure was repeated.</p>
            <p>In a first step the group had to define the competencies undergraduates should obtain and the related learning objectives. In the next step the group members were invited to suggest topics to be covered by the program which were considered to be essential parts of basic knowledge. After having agreed on the topics experts were invited to contribute to the topics chosen by sending slides to the chair and vice chair. Each slide had to be accompanied by learning objectives, text, references and self-assessment questions for the students. The chair and vice chair integrated the material into a first format of the 10 topics and sent the proposals out for review and comments from the group. This procedure was repeated several times to arrive at the final format which is shown in the text below and accessible through the internet link given at the end</p>

                <p>Sexual health is closely linked to both physical and mental wellbeing

                    </sup>. It encompasses the life of the individual as a fundamental component, constantly evolving and changing with it. Accordingly, sexuality is closely related to general health and for this reason, various medical conditions and treatments can have a negative impact on a person's sexual function, interpersonal relationships and well-being
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-7">7</xref>,

                    </sup>. The importance to not overlook sexuality appears evident at the time of a cancer treatment, for example, where most often the side effects impact heavily on the interpersonal (intimate) relationship of the patient and may affect therapy adherence
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-9">9</xref>
                    </sup>; or, in those cases in which a sexual dysfunction can represent a marker of an underlying, non-diagnosed, illness
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-10">10</xref>,

                    </sup>. Therefore, it is crucial for healthcare providers to consider and address their patients' sexual health alongside other medical issues.</p>
                <p>Various barriers have been identified at the time of a clinical visit, that prevent both healthcare providers and patients to talk freely about sexual health issues. Among these, some of the most frequently reported are: lack of training in communication, fear of offending the patient, discomfort with discussing sexual health, lack of education and competence in treating sexual health issues and lack of time in the appointment
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-12">12</xref>
                    </sup>. Patients view sexual health as an important aspect of their well-being and happiness, but they are afraid and may feel ashamed to address intimate issues. They expect their physicians to first open the discussion about sexual health problems
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-13">13</xref>&#x2013;
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-16">16</xref>
                    </sup>. However, many doctors feel they lack adequate education on sexual health and, consequently, do not routinely inquire about sexuality because they feel incompetent or are afraid to lose too much time
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-17">17</xref>&#x2013;

                    </sup>.</p>
                <p>A significant contributing factor to this, identified repeatedly in the literature, is the insufficient attention given to sexual health education in medical school
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-5">5</xref>,

                    </sup>.</p>
                <p>Despite the broadly acknowledged importance of sexual health education in medicine, many medical schools still do not offer sufficient training on this topic
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-19">19</xref>,

                    </sup>. This gap in education must be addressed to better equip future physicians with the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary to provide comprehensive care for their patients
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-24">24</xref>
                    </sup>. Medical schools should prioritize the inclusion of sexual health education in their curriculums, providing students with the resources and opportunities to develop their competence in this area. This matters also for those universities that may already implement some components of sexual medicine but do so only for topics related to sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy, reproductive anatomy, and infertility. A comprehensive sexual medicine education should be composed of a multidisciplinary curriculum, providing a health-oriented, biopsychosocial view of human sexuality
                    <sup>

                <p>The available education in the field of sexology typically consists of national programs that encompass a range of courses. These programs may lead to a degree, certificate, or diploma in different areas and levels of sexology 
                    <italic toggle="yes">(trained in; doctor in; sexologist; sex therapist; etc.).</italic> The majority of this training focuses on providing additional education to professionals who have already acquired a primary educational level. For this reason, it is more common to find sexual health and medicine education in complementary, master or postgraduate courses. </p>
                <p>In the last two decades the postgraduate education in sexual health, sexual medicine and sexology has seen an enormous growth, mainly through European and International Scientific societies. In particular: International Society for Sexual Medicine (ISSM), European Society for Sexual Medicine (ESSM), International society for the Study of Women&#x2019;s Sexual Health (ISSWSH) and several national societies as well as various universities. The concern remains that sexuality and sexual health care are not well integrated into the undergraduate education for future health care professionals including training in medicine and psychology, as at best sexuality education may be offered as elective courses within the basic health professional curriculum. In most European universities, sexology is not an essential component of the teaching curriculum, even for medical students. This marginalization within the existing educational system makes it difficult to enable future health care professionals to provide basic sexual health care.</p>

                <p>Developing a comprehensive sexual medicine curriculum does not concern only the ability to resume and integrate a variety of multidisciplinary concepts around sexual health. The number of challenges that must be considered is not insignificant as they encompass the whole educational environment of sexual medicine.</p>

                </p>
                <p>The first challenge is to create a curriculum that respects quality criteria, the most important one being that the information provided is 
                    <bold>scientifically accurate</bold>, 
                    <bold>complete, up-to-date and adapted to its final receivers</bold>. It should not be limited to anatomy and pathology, and should instead provide knowledge about aspects of biology, psychology, and social factors altogether (i.e., the biopsychosocial model of human sexuality)
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-32">32</xref>
                    </sup>. It should not overlap with the same depth topics that are already taught in medical courses, but should identify them accordingly, so that students can learn and integrate available knowledge inside a more holistic approach. The development of such an educational package should be guided by inputs from different healthcare specialties and disciplines: obstetrics, gynecology, urology, psychiatry; sex therapists, psychologists, and sexologists; and public health experts
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-24">24</xref>,

                    </sup>. Another step towards this holistic approach would aim to create a working group composed of international experts from different countries and regions, to assure the inclusion of different sociocultural and political backgrounds important to understand patients&#x2019; concerns and sexual problems.</p>
                <p>From a didactic point of view the challenge lies in harmonizing topics of human biology, psychology and social and political aspects, without overweighting too much a single topic. The educational level should be comprehensive, but not go beyond the level of the current courses on human anatomy, pathology, etc. It should result in a balanced biopsychosocial educational package on sexual health without deepening or discounting too much. Most importantly, the sexual medicine curriculum should include topics that are missing or not covered enough from the current available courses (i.e. gender minorities and inclusive care, digital sexuality, non-normative sexual behavior, sexuality and aging, sexual coercion and violence, sexual rights, to cite a few)
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-24">24</xref>
                    </sup>, and should be aimed at developing those skills that practicing physicians identify as challenging (i.e. sexual history taking)
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-26">26</xref>
                    </sup>.</p>
                <p>Another challenging aspect is that this curriculum should, where possible, be applied to a larger pool of students other than just those of medical schools. The rationale is simple: given the strict linkage between health and sexuality, it is highly likely that healthcare professionals of all kinds will come across patients who have questions or difficulties related to their sexual health
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-24">24</xref>
                    </sup>. Moreover, it is strongly suggested that this should start during the first years of University, rather than the latest and or during residencies, as difficulty in discussing the sexual health of patients emerges prior to graduation
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-34">34</xref>
                    </sup> and is easier to overcome if students can practice during their routine care
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-28">28</xref>

                </p>
                <p>Effective delivery of the Curriculum to students faces three main challenges. </p>
                <p>The first consists of tailoring the program to the social climate of the students. Current generations, studying today at university level, were born and raised through a digital era, to which their ability to learn is connected
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-25">25</xref>
                    </sup>. In this sense, implementation through internet platforms, modular and accessible anytime, anywhere to learn and practice at their will could represent a dissemination modality to be preferred, especially considering the evolution of digital technologies for self-help and sexual health
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-35">35</xref>
                    </sup>.</p>
                <p>The second, far more important, is that this tailored and timed education should connect knowledge acquisition with attitude formation and skills practice. To detach from a purely theoretical approach and instead opt for an experiential learning approach: through the use of roleplay, workshops, case discussion and standardized patients; through (multidisciplinary) team-work and direct constructive feedback from peers and educators. The resulting increase in knowledge and 
                    <italic toggle="yes">savoir-faire</italic> allows one to develop a professional attitude, as discussed in the next section.</p>
                <p>The third challenging aspect relates to both content creation and student education. A key component of the curriculum is to develop and foster a professional stance. By teaching about the diversity of sexual expression, the curriculum shall prepare to meet patients with different sexual values and expression in respect to one&#x2019;s own. There is no interest in altering the student&#x2019;s subjective view of sexuality, but rather the objective is to raise awareness and the ability to maintain an objective, unbiased, non-judgmental evidence-based stance during patient care for a sexual concern
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-5">5</xref>,

                    </sup>.</p>
                <p>Finally, the last challenges regard the mode of implementation, the University structure (Faculty, Educational board) and the sustainability of the curriculum.</p>
                <p>An implementation modality to bring sexual health care in medical schools would be to integrate its components into multiple courses throughout the years of training
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-5">5</xref>,

                    </sup>. Considering the current limited space of medical schools curricula for new courses, and the general burden placed on students, the above mentioned proposal is not feasible. A solution to this is represented by shorter implementations, such as modules as short as two days of activities, that connect evidence-based knowledge and skills practice. In the literature, this kind of implementation has been preferred by students, implemented by universities
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-37">37</xref>
                    </sup>, and has demonstrated positive lasting effects even after ten years
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-20">20</xref>
                    </sup>.</p>
                <p>	Another limitation is represented by a lack of resources, training and time by the faculty of the interested medical school. In this case, external experts could be invited to provide education on sexual health topics, both to students and to willing faculty members
                    <sup>
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-25">25</xref>
                    </sup>. At the same time, formal approval by the university educational board might become another complexity.</p>
                <p>	A final challenge concerns the educational curriculum maintenance and follow up. A comprehensive sexual medicine curriculum, as stated, would need to be updated according to new relevant research, alongside the faculty of experts that may present it; it would need an administrative body, to regulate and manage financial and human resources, and a disseminative body, to bring the curriculum to the attention of willing stakeholders and institutions. </p>
                <p>To conclude, both students, specialists, researchers and experts have highlighted the need for further sexual medicine education within the undergraduate years. For this reason, a well-timed and implemented curriculum might allow for a seeding process for sexual healthcare, as even a short training program (two days or less) can have a long-lasting impact on the medical competence and confidence in addressing sexual health issues, all to the benefit of patients. </p>

                <p>The skills training part of the curriculum should focus on the specific challenges regarding communication and counseling on sexual and reproductive health. It is important to address sexual health issues in a patient centered way and when addressing issues in a couple to respectfully consider both partners perspectives.</p>
                <p>Patient centered communication in Sexual Medicine can include a whole range of topics such as reassuring patients of privacy and explaining confidentially, making efforts to ensure trust and openness, and avoiding assumptions (on topics like sexual orientation, gender identity, monogamy, sexual activities, or age-related practices).</p>
                <p>This part should be taught by videos and discussions with students (i.e. role play), in particular: </p>

                    <bold>After having elaborated and agreed on the main components of a competence-based program in sexual medicine for undergraduates the working group developed the material to allow universities to implement the teaching of basic sexual medicine and sexual health care in existing undergraduate curricula.</bold>
                </p>
                <p>The material can be used according to the needs of the undergraduate educational program of medical schools (universities) and academic institutions for the teaching of psychology defined by the respective responsible academic board or dean. Singular topics and a combination of topics can be integrated into the curriculum in the Bachelor or Master program (divided or total). In universities not following the Bologna system the material can be used according to the respective educational needs.</p>

                <p>This part of the curriculum is developed based on the broad understanding of human sexuality as an experience and behavior which integrates biological and psychosocial factors and processes interacting with each other. Based on this concept the 10 topics agreed upon are covered by a respective slide set. Each slide has defined learning objectives, text, references and questions for self-control. These 10 topics represent the comprehensive library (see

                <p>This module provides the basic knowledge about the development of human sexuality along the life course taking into account that sexuality is a not a fixed unchangeable dimension of life but that there are typical developmental aims and strands which expose individuals to life stage related sexual difficulties demanding age sensitive sexual health care from childhood to adolescence, midlife to the elderly individuals and couples. Diseases are part of human life and have an impact on sexual health through biological and psychosocial changes. The module provides an understanding of the different levels through which diseases and treatment can affect sexuality, how a sexual dysfunction in the context of a medical condition can be diagnosed and what the therapeutic options are.</p>

The communication should take into account that an individual&#x2019;s sexuality is composed of sexual identity, emotional and sexual orientation, gender identity which develop over the life course. Therefore, sexual history taking should encourage the patient to talk about all these aspects in an environment of trust and respect. The video should be viewed together with students, allow feedback and questions from the student.</p>
                <p>The moderator should encourage the students to look at specific elements of the communication:</p>

            <title>Summary</title>
            <p>Based on the support of the COST-Action ESMN experts from different countries convened to define the necessary elements and components of a competence-based curriculum for undergraduate university students in sexual health/sexual medicine based on reviews and expert discussions. After having agreed on competencies and learning objectives the content of the knowledge, skills and attitude elements of the program were developed following a modified Delphi procedure of multidisciplinary and multinational collaboration realized in personal and virtual meetings.</p>
            <p>Ten topics were developed. Each topic consists of a slide set whereby each slide is accompanied by learning objectives, text, references and questions for self-evaluation. These ten topics build the background library which can be used by the respective teachers. Following the requirements of the ECTS the material of the ten topics was integrated into five modules covering the major themes (sexual health and rights, biology and psychology, threats to sexual health, sexual dysfunctions, life course approach to sexuality including medical sexology, diversity and digitalization, compulsive sexual behavior and paraphilias). For skills training two teaching videos (sexual history taking, sexual counselling) were produced.</p>
            <p>The material of the curriculum can be used at different times and in different combinations during the undergraduate curriculum of medicine and psychology.</p>

        <body>
            <p>The authors present a well-detailed discussion of the 4-year process undertaken by a working group of experts with varied expertise in sexual health to develop a sexual health curriculum for European undergraduate medical education. The group acknowledges the complexities in not only the topic, but more importantly the training of the topic throughout medical education.&#x00a0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The strengths of the piece include the depth of expertise included, the anchoring to the WHO definition of sexual health, the biopsychosocial-lifespan approach taken, the attempt to delineate knowledge/skills/attitudes needed to provide comprehensive sexual health care, the detailing of the topic/module breakdown, the development of 2 videos to accompany the curriculum, and the acknowledgment that the curriculum may be implemented in various ways depending on the needs of each individual program.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The areas where the manuscript can continue to be strengthened include: 
                <list list-type="bullet">
                    <list-item>
                        <p>Discussion of the role of pleasure in addition to well-being early on in the framing</p>

                    <list-item>
                        <p>Including education professionals as a part of the team to help revise the objectives in a more measurable fashion (consider the work of Bloom's Taxonomy, Kirkpatrick levels of measurement) -- for example one action verb per objective and utilizing appropriate action verbs for knowledge vs. attitude vs. skill objectives, "Identify..."Weigh..." "Demonstrate"</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>Consider further delineation in the sections to better detail which are the knowledge objectives vs. attitude objectives vs. skill objectives as this will help with what to implement when and determine which is foundational before moving to next steps (i.e. learning definitions/diagnoses before practicing history-taking)</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>Consider building in a section to reflect on the learner's history related to sexual health (identifying culture, values/attitudes/beliefs, discomforts) and how personal experiences may impact care provided</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>Consider either shifting the gendered modules to "cisgender women" "cisgender men" or combining them to include "across genders" and include cisgender and transgender populations</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>In the discussion of treating, make sure to include a discussion of sexual pharmacology and the impact of medication effects on sexual health</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>In the discussion of various populations not often included, make sure to include those with disabilities and chronic conditions</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>The framing mentions "couples" many times throughout and given the variety of relationship structures today, the group may want to consider an approach in training that allows learners to be prepared to care for any patient regardless of relationship structure instead of possible implicit expectations of being in a coupled relationship structure</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>Consider including evaluation metrics with the curriculum (which will be easier to include with measurable action verbs across the objectives)</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>

            <body>
                <p>Dear Dr. Bayer, Thank you for your invaluable insights and precise observations. The references suggested will be of great help.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> We would like to address your points as follows:</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> - Regarding point 1, 6, and 7, the material provided indeed covers the role of pleasure (Topic 1), the impact of pharmacology on sexuality (across various Topics, such as 5, 6 and 7) and sexuality in the presence of disabilities or chronic conditions (Topic 7). We will review the contents described in the article to be more extensive and include the ones above. &#x00a0;</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> - For points 2, 3 and 9, involvement of professionals with a background in education is at the top of our priorities. We will focus on delineating knowledge, attitude, and skills objectives (as suggested) for each subject and introducing specific exercises following each topic. Connected to your point 4, in the drafts currently available one of these comes close to your suggestion.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> &#x00a0; - Concerning points 5 and 8, a careful revision of gender specific language, including the dyadic relationship framework, will be conducted. We commit to a thorough review, to ensure more inclusivity and widening nonbinary aspects.&#x00a0;</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p> - In conclusion, we will review the article to provide a more balanced and polished presentation. We have also noted the missing punctuation and errors within the manuscript, that we will edit and rectify. Your expertise offers us potential to grow as educators, and we look forward to presenting a comprehensive version of the curriculum in the near future.</p>
