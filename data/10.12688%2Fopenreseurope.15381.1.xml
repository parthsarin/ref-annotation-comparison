                    <bold>Background:</bold> The paper investigates aspects of gender equality in the implementation process of charging infrastructure with the innovative solutions for &#x201c;USER centric Charging Infrastructure project&#x201d; (short: USER-CHI) as reference. The USER-CHI project offers possible solutions for user-friendly e-Mobility surrounding the Mediterranean and Scandinavian Trans European Network corridors. In this regard of providing user-friendly solutions, the need for further information to recognize gender bias in the implementation process arose. 
                    <bold>Methods:</bold>Therefore, the paper combines insights from the project&#x2019;s product development and a literature review results of gender bias in infrastructure and mobility planning. It aims at providing knowledge about gender-specific and diverse user needs which then can be incorporated into the design of charging infrastructure.</p>
                <p>
                    <bold>Results:</bold> The term &#x201c;gender bias&#x201d; is commonly understood as opinionated actions or ideas as said by the gender-grounded receptivity that women are not associated to men in status and rights. Projects in the realm of electrification of mobility and its infrastructures lack in diversity sensitivity. This paper addresses these gaps by evaluating existing datasets from the User Chi project and identifying gender bias in literature research of the mobility and transport field. 
                    <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The authors conclude that more diverse approaches are needed. Due to the limitations of the available dataset, the authors apply a differentiation between male and female usage patterns and needs in mobility solutions as a starting point. Therefore, the recommendations made in this paper focus on the accessibility of electric mobility and charging infrastructure for women while setting the goal to establish a more diverse (respectively gender neutral) access to this type of mobility.</p>

            <p>The paper investigates the equality of men and women in connection with the implementation process of charging infrastructure. The User-Chi project is a reference to this research topic. The User-Chi project creates solutions for user-friendly e-mobility in the area surrounding the Mediterranean and Scandinavian Trans European Network corridors. During this creation process, it became necessary to learn more about the equality between men and women in connection to the charging infrastructure. The paper seeks to offer a summary about specific differences in user needs between men and women and how this knowledge can be integrated into the design of charging infrastructure. When thinking about the equality and inequality of men and women especially in infrastructure, the current system of electric mobility is not ideal for women. The paper offers recommendations that make it easier for women to access electric mobility.</p>

The project is funded by European Union&#x2019;s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme and aims to promote and expand the e-mobility market. During the project, different products are developed and tested, which seek to increase the user&#x2019;s acceptance and accessibility of charging infrastructure. The testing sites are located in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (ES), Berlin (DE), Budapest (HU), Rome (IT) and Turku (FI).

            <p>In this regard, the need for further information to recognise gender bias throughout the implementation process arose between several city partners. According to their concerns, there is a gap that must be filled in gender bias when planning and implementing the charging infrastructure for a user-friendly e-mobility.

            <p>Addressing this need, the paper combines insights from the project&#x2019;s product development and a literature review on documented differences in society as well as presumable effects of this gender bias transferred in infrastructure and mobility planning. It aims at providing knowledge about gender-specific differences in user needs which then can be incorporated into the design of charging infrastructure. According to the authors' understanding, the discussion on gender equality encompasses all genders. However, due to the limitations of available datasets, literature  and state of research

                <p>The paper intends to provide an overview on gender bias in literature and the mobility projects as well as to enable approaches which help to design an inclusive planning and implementation process for the full-scale expansion of the electric charging infrastructure (ECI). Therefore, a dual approach is applied: First, extensive literature research and meta-analysis of data to a large extent provided by USER-CHI partner IBV were conducted in order to find evidence concerning the existence of a gender bias in mobility. As previously stated, the presumable effects of gender bias in literature and differences in the meta-analysis of the project data set were transferred in the field of infrastructure and mobility planning, due to the limitations of available research. To address this research gap, the review gives implications of gender biases in infrastructure planning. Subsequently as a second step, conclusions were drawn from the results of the research and analysis which were then directly applied to the currently developed products of the USER-CHI project, intended to provide recommendations to overcome this bias.</p>

This report presents the work performed by USER-CHI consortium members from February 2020 to October 2020, to define the users&#x2019; needs and expectations related to project products. The data set used for this paper was collected with a mix-method approach by one partner of the consortium (IBV) during this time. IBV used for the end user insights the qualitative method of field diaries

Each city was asked to contact a total number of 15 end users with different profiles (long range user professional, low range user private, LEV user and long-range user). IBV used two standardized online questionnaires as the quantitative method

It was conducted as a keyword search in title, abstract and full text using key words as &#x201c;gender equality&#x201d;, &#x201c;gender discrimination&#x201d; and &#x201c;gender bias&#x201d; in connection with &#x201c;road infrastructure&#x201d;, &#x201c;mobility sector&#x201d; and &#x201c;e-mobility&#x201d;. The databases used include established literature databases such as google scholar, academia.edu, sciencedirect.com and researchgate.net and focused geographically on scientific papers from Europe and Northern America. The main focus of the literature overview is to define and describe gender bias in e-mobility, focusing especially on the charging infrastructure. In conclusion to this procedure, the authors analysed a total of forty sources. In kind of a pioneer position, the literature overviews referred to gender in overall mobility and infrastructure to give a first overview of an underrated topic.</p>

In a second step, conclusions from the research were identified and collected. according to the following, newly formed key factors: mobility patterns, financial aspects and security aspects. Under these key factors, identified aspects of gender bias in charging infrastructure were concluded. Parallel to that, the products still being developed in the USER-CHI project were taken into consideration in order to identify eligible products to link the specific theoretical conclusions directly with the practical tools. Within this step, the authors won&#x2019;t reproduce stereotypes. There are gender differences in mode choice, and it can be proved that these are linked to several structural gender inequalities in society (see chapter Foundations: Aspects of gender (in)equality and linkage to transport infrastructure). The link to practical tools and products of USER-CHI tries to do a first step in breaking existing structures instead of reproducing. In summary, bridging literature research results and data analysis with the USER-CHI products will allow recommendations for more diversity in design choices of charging infrastructure, thus contributing to the goal of an inclusively user-centric charging infrastructure landscape in Europe.</p>

                <p>In recent years, researchers in the field of general infrastructure realised peculiarities of the different genders as individual realities which are worth being included as a parameter in studies. Past planning and implementation processes of projects in these fields lack sufficient consideration of diverse transport needs. This conclusion is not a new one: As early as in the 1960s, the built-in effects of urban planning after the Athens Charta (CIAM 1933) with its promotion of the &#x201c;functional city&#x201d; &#x2013; a city which separates the functions of dwelling, working, recreation, and transportation

                    </sup> To his analysis, cities planned in this sense presented themselves inconsiderate to the tendencies of more women entering the workforce while inhabiting the role of mothers, lacked playgrounds for children as well as sport areas for adolescents, and in general spaces for friendships and neighbourly human behaviour.</p>
                <p>From these early critiques, there is a continuity to more recent findings that the average city structure particularly benefits the male population of a city as most women take shorter and more frequent trips due to gender-typical distribution of responsibilities in the household.

                    </sup> To this day, the existing infrastructure and its geographical distribution can only be described as invariably unequal. The circumstance of the inequality alone is to be considered as problematic, even more so considering that general infrastructure is deemed the central driver for social advantage and disadvantage. What may create connectivity for some will on the other hand lead to the production of barriers and boundaries for others.

                <p>This lack of consideration of multiple variants of mobility patterns in the transport infrastructure can also be framed as an effect of gender bias.

                <p>Whilst the general infrastructure and mobility sector is able to present a noteworthy amount of research dedicated to immanent gendered parameters, there are certain areas within the overall research which fail to provide specific data concerning a potential gender bias in its conception.

According to this understanding, women are considered the primary care givers for the family, meaning that they are responsible for domestic chores as well as the care of dependent children, elderly relatives, and the sick.

                <p>There appears to be several reasons explaining this reality. First and foremost, women tend to be subject to financial contingencies due to the existing income gap between men and women meaning that women earn less than men whilst doing the same work.

In general, cars are displayed as a necessity for men to care for their families. It is often thereby connected to the image of a successful and powerful man driving a car that &#x201c;completes&#x201d; him as a person.

                <p>The recognisable gender bias in the general mobility sector as well as individual electro mobility and charging infrastructure makes the system itself vulnerable to disadvantages. It is assumed that a system which is to be regarded as a one-sided system due to gender bias must also be described as an inefficient system. The reason for this is that the system at best benefits parts and at worst fractions of the entirety. In this way, it can never be fully utilised. On the same basis, the system cannot claim sustainability.

            <p>Due to particular needs of women, which lead to specific characteristics influencing women&#x2019;s mobility, electric cars do not appear to be the default solution.

                </sup> Therefore, the recommendations made should focus on the intention to make the usage of electric mobility more accessible for women and at the same time set the goal to a gender-neutral access to this type of mobility. Jane Jacobs showed an approach for the field of urban planning that could be transferred in its basic features to the planning of the charging infrastructure of electromobility. She writes that in the attempt to create diversity, it is necessary to include a &#x201c;mixture of functions&#x201d; in a neighbourhood, rather than separating areas in commercial, residential, and cultural spaces.

                    <xref ref-type="other" rid="FN85">85</xref>
                </sup> This approach shall be considered as the baseline for the following recommendations.</p>
            <p>In the following the conclusions previously drawn in this paper shall be applied to a specific project &#x2013; the USER-CHI Project &#x2013; in order to illustrate and incentivise approaches aiming at including women&#x2019;s needs in future electromobility projects.</p>
            <p>The USER-CHI Project focuses on the co-creation and demonstration of smart solutions around seven connecting nodes of the Mediterranean and Scandinavian-Mediterranean Trans European Network-Transport (TEN-T). Several of these solutions shall be presented in the follow-up, and at the same time approaches within the applications shall be proposed that represent a fundamental contribution to the integration of the special needs of women in the context of the development of an electronic charging infrastructure.</p>
            <p>One USER-CHI product is the Charging infrastructure Location Concept development kit (

                    <sup>

                </bold>). This planning tool addresses mainly municipalities aiming at extending their charging infrastructure by using different data regarding the city and its districts such as demographic statistics and previous usage of electric vehicles. It is designed to provide recommendations of the position, amount, and preferable technology of future charging points in a certain area. The tool will be tested in a two staged implementation during the term of the project by the city partners. The tool will be accompanied by user support materials developed in the project, too, as well as by workshops. So far it is not clear, in which way CLICK recognises a possible gender bias in the demographic data set. Overall, there is a possibility to introduce gender equality in the planning tool, by including behavioural patterns and usage of electric vehicles in future adaptions of the algorithm. Such a planning and programming process should be designed to recognise and process gender sensitive information.</p>
            <p>This could be achieved explicitly through the inclusion of gender-sensitive data within the four-stage CLICK application. Therein, step 3 (&#x201c;feed data&#x201d;) and step 4 (&#x201c;get recommendations&#x201d;) require addressees to feed gender sensitive data to the tool such as distribution of inhabitants regarding male and female or the number of families in the area. Apart from that, it can be further requested to characterise a certain neighbourhood as a socially advantaged or disadvantaged area. Finally, a variety of other criteria may be considered in order to receive recommendations as accurate as possible such as the amount of privately owned charging infrastructure; number of schools and kindergartens in the area as well as other facilities often visited by women due to phenomenon of mobility of care.</p>
            <p>As a result, the recommendations provided should mirror the gender sensitive information by highlighting locations which either acknowledge specific security needs of women such as well-lit places for charging infrastructure as well as public places or places near entrances of buildings and residential buildings. On the other hand, women&#x2019;s specific rapid mobility pattern needs to be taken into account when enumerating recommendations such as fast-charging stations in front of kindergartens or schools, shops, doctors&#x2019; offices and nursing homes. Furthermore, the recommendations for the location itself should adapt to the environment and its inherent conditions. An illustrative example may be to propose a collective e-bike charging station in front of park entrances or playgrounds instead of charging stations for cars to minimise traffic and thus avoid accidents and to additionally achieve a diversification of the mobility options.</p>

                </sup>- Integrated Solar DC Charging for Light Electric Vehicles. This charging station is designed with solar panel roof for e-bikes and e-scooters as a solution combining charging, onsite production of renewable energy and theft-proof parking. Besides being a climate-friendly solution and representing multimodal instead of solely car-based mobility options, the product also refers to transport modes being more likely used by women. This is due to the special demands women are facing in the context of the mobility of care phenomenon. Therefore, the design of the charging point itself may contribute to reach more gender equality in the electric charging infrastructure. Such an inclusive design could include measures like roofed charging points, storage areas to enable unloading shopping without any difficulties and perimeter surrounding the charging point in cases where it is located near roads in order to hinder children from running out into the street. Furthermore, it could be advantageous to provide charging stations for cargo bikes with enough space between single charging points to move around the vehicle. Additionally, the installation of an emergency button able to trigger silent and loud alarms may seem sensible to increase the feeling of security of women. The explicit location of these charging stations could follow the recommendations previously mentioned.</p>

Therefore, it also sets an opportunity to improve the general feeling of safety in particular due to an alternative usage to cable charging. Furthermore, it could meet practical needs resulting from the previously mentioned specific needs due to women&#x2019;s mobility patterns and in regard to mobility of care. INDUCAR aims to be less time consuming and reversely a more time effective method than conventional charging infrastructure, that could support women.</p>

This handbook includes guidelines and recommendations to design the perfect user-centric charging station. The purpose is to accelerate the widespread usage of electric vehicles, encouraging users of different social groups and market segments to overcome existing acceptance barriers, and therefore providing viable business models to private stakeholders. It addresses CPOs, EMPs/MSPs and other private stakeholders of the electromobility field. On the one hand, it could raise awareness concerning the existence and specific circumstances surrounding gender inequality within the general transport infrastructure and accordingly charging infrastructure - especially the key factors listed above. On the other hand, it could provide guidance and recommendations regarding the creation of either public or private financing models for the use of charging infrastructure. Such financing structures could integrate reduced pricing systems for certain age groups given that there is an increased probability of old-age poverty among women. In addition to that, provisions for specific travel periods for example more economical tariffs during night hours to ensure safe transport to one's home or provisions concerning the means of transport including cheaper tariffs for e-bikes rather than electric vehicles could be promoted in the handbook.</p>

            <title>Outlook</title>
            <p>While a comprehensive scientific overview of the question of the existence of a gender bias in electric charging infrastructure cannot yet be clearly answered, it is probably recognisable that the problem of gender inequality in the field of infrastructure planning and implementation has been identified. It can be assumed that in future projects of planning and implementation of charging infrastructure projects, criteria leading to an adjustment of gender inequality will be increasingly included. It remains to be said, however, that the current approach to planning and implementing charging infrastructure projects is largely oriented towards the status quo and as a result carries the existing gender bias in the field of general infrastructure on to new fields such as charging infrastructure. The USER-CHI project could counteract the status quo of a gender bias in charging infrastructure by fully exploiting the existing potential of the individual products. According to the proposals, the topic around gender bias could be brought into the focus of development and proposed solutions could be developed that are oriented towards the concrete ideas of this paper. Future research needs to address gender and diversity issues to establish sustainable and future oriented mobility and transport infrastructures. Because of this, it is also necessary to approach the topic from a conceptualised side. Especially with regard to which concepts scientists can use to assess a non-discriminatory and diversely accessible infrastructure. Nonetheless, focussing on creating for example a system of categories to assess diversity in transport. In this way, the USER-CHI project could develop even further into a lighthouse project that serves as a blueprint for the central questions and criteria for the future planning of charging infrastructure.</p>

        <body>
            <p>Summary: The authors address a very real and important research gap, the results could be transferrable not just to other European countries, but to other developed countries. I would like to see a clearer definition of gender bias (particularly in the context of transport infrastructure design), The definition in the Abstract is a bit clunky, the EIGE definition on p.7 is more useful. Otherwise, the scope of this paper is well defined.&#x00a0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> I wondered what the colour coding in Fig 1 represents &#x2013; a key would be useful. I wondered how user&#x2019;s acceptance and accessibility are measured, and if there was some initial assessment to provide a baseline against which any change could be benchmarked? P.9 mentions an &#x201c;inefficient system&#x201d;. It&#x2019;s possible to make a better link between the conclusions if the authors make it clearer how the Charging Infrastructure is being assessed.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The data gathering methodology is well described and appropriate for the research questions. The charging infrastructure user survey sample size of 1,800 is adequate. The literature review of 40 papers at the gender/mobility nexus is also adequate, and the literature search approach is well described.&#x00a0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> However, the Results section could be structured better. It is not clear that what follows is an analysis of the 40 sources. This section seems to contain additional content (not the 40 papers) that could be moved to the Motivation and Scope section. The thematic analysis of the papers staring on p. 7 could be summarised in a table to highlight the findings. I didn&#x2019;t see any analysis of the user survey in the Results section.&#x00a0;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The set of recommendations could be better linked to the analysis of the papers. The authors say the results are used in the &#x201c;USER-CHI project in a specific and practical way&#x201d;. However, the &#x201c;Approaches and recommendations&#x201d; section seems to be suggestions for how the tools/products could be adapted, rather than evidence that they were adapted to incorporate gender perspectives.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The authors conclude more diverse approaches (to charging infrastructure design) are needed. This is true, and I think the authors also mean that existing approaches should be modified to take account of the diverse needs of stakeholders. There is a need to ensure gender mainstreaming, i.e., that gender needs are included at the outset in all transport infrastructure development, the set of recommendations starting on p.9 give some useful suggestions on what future (transport infrastructure) projects should be alert to.</p>
            <p>If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?</p>
            <p>Not applicable</p>
            <p>Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?</p>
            <p>Partly</p>
            <p>Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it engage with the current literature?</p>
            <p>Partly</p>
            <p>Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?</p>
            <p>Partly</p>
            <p>Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?</p>
            <p>Partly</p>
            <p>Are all the source data and materials underlying the results available?</p>
            <p>Partly</p>
            <p>Reviewer Expertise:</p>
            <p>Operations Research; Clean Energy Transition; Gender Equality;</p>
            <p>I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above.</p>

            <p>This paper discusses and important issue for the future of charging infrastructure and the project discussed is much needed. I enjoyed it. However, I think more clarity of the write up of the approach is required to ensure that the important message of the paper is fully delivered. I provide some specific details on these points below.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Abstract: 
                <list list-type="bullet">
                    <list-item>
                        <p>It could be more clearly stated here what exactly was done within the literature review. It is not very clearly written and therefore the key aim is not as clear as it could be.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>&#x2018;Gender bias&#x2019; is also typically referring to the bias in datasets which have traditionally captured more male data in the mobility domain, and therefore the data used to inform mobility and its design is biased towards males.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                        <p>You state in the plain language summary that women are disadvantaged currently within the development of charging infrastructure, this would be of interest to be included within the abstract.</p>
                    </list-item>

            <p> More inclusion of the gender data gap &#x2013; alongside the other factors on page 7. A lack of data on females and their use and experience of systems has led to a bias towards the needs of males. Future work to overcome this should seek to have balanced and representative samples of males and female participants. Disaggregation of data on gender is also vital to ensure that potential gender differences are identified. This approach should be taken with the future gender-equity approach which is proposed and the CLICK application with the &#x2018;gender sensitive data&#x2019;.</p>

            <p> Within electric mobility, it seems that your focus is on electric vehicles. But there is growing research in the field of electric micromobility, e.g. ebikes and escooters, which considers gender equity. This is not referred to. Is this intentional? If so the scope of the area of focus should be stated early on.</p>

            <p>The paper is developed in the framework of USER-CHI European project. The aim is to show the aspects of gender equality in the implementation process of charging infrastructure.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The authors claim to use the data told in a questionnaire but this is not at all enhanced in the paper and it is not at all clear to me what data were obtained and how they were used for this research.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> I think the structure of the paper deserves a thoughtful revision, I think some titles are either too general or do not fully reflect the content such as "Literature review" or "Analysis".</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> There are two Horizon projects that have dealt precisely with gender issues in transport and mobility: DIAMOND and TINNGO. I recommend seeing the material produced to enrich some of the concepts.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> The introductory part ("Foundations: ..) is a bit dispersive in reading as well as the chapter more focused on transportation and mobility, beware of repetition of concepts that make the reading chaotic.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Much appreciated and well-structured is the section on project tools and their potentials, which in my opinion is the heart of the paper and should be better emphasized.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> Finally, I suggest to the authors a re-reading of the paper as some typos (User Chi instead of USER-CHI) are present as well as inappropriate truncated words (e.g. won't).</p>
            <p>If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?</p>
            <p>Not applicable</p>
            <p>Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?</p>
            <p>Partly</p>
            <p>Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it engage with the current literature?</p>
            <p>Partly</p>
            <p>Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?</p>
            <p>Not applicable</p>
            <p>Are all the source data and materials underlying the results available?</p>
            <p>Yes</p>
            <p>Reviewer Expertise:</p>
            <p>Transport systems</p>
            <p>I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above.</p>
